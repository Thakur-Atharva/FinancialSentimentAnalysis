MMM,"[""MMMZacks Equity ResearchNovember 2, 2023 at 6:00 AM·5 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowMMMWatchlist3M (MMM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this maker of Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics have returned +2.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, which 3M falls in, has lost 8.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.3M is expected to post earnings of $2.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -9.7%. This estimate has changed +2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.85 indicates a change of +8% from what 3M is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, 3M is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of 3M, the consensus sales estimate of $7.67 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -5%. The $31.76 billion and $32.39 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -7.2% and +2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise History3M reported revenues of $8.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.6%. EPS of $2.68 for the same period compares with $2.69 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.95 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.52%. The EPS surprise was +14.53%.Over the last four quarters, 3M surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.3M is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about 3M. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of income-generating stocks and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Income.\xa0Markets are wavering amid a mix of corporate earnings reports that didn't meet expectations and worries about rising interest rates. Notably, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note briefly surpassed the 5% mark, a level not seen in 16 years, which further contributed to investor concerns. They are now looking more at assets that generate income due to the current uncertainty. A strong income-focused portfolio combines various income-generating assets like bonds, dividend stocks, and real estate. This mix helps lower risks and enhances the potential for steady, long-term returns.Also read: 12 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive IncomeDividend stocks offer more than just income; they create a virtuous cycle of growth. Strong dividend growth is beneficial for investors in several ways. It can enhance returns and act as a shield against inflation by offering a steadily increasing income stream, much like an annual raise in your earnings. Additionally, dividend-growing stocks have the potential for price appreciation because they often reflect a company's improving earnings and dividend payments over time. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, historically, large-cap dividend-growing stocks have shown resilience during market downturns, experienced smaller losses, and performed well when the market remained stable. In addition, they've managed to capture a significant portion of the market's upswings during more favorable economic conditions. The report also mentioned that over the period from 1985 to 2022, companies that increased their dividends within the Russell 1000 Index outperformed the overall market index, and they did so with less volatility.Lower volatility is one of the factors that attract investors to dividend stocks. The reduced price fluctuations in dividend stocks can provide a sense of stability and predictability in an investor's portfolio, which is especially appealing to those who prioritize income generation and want to avoid significant market ups and downs. Wisdom Tree reported that over the past 64 years, dividend levels decreased in just six years, and only once did they drop by more than 5%. In contrast, stock prices experienced declines in 18 of those 64 years, with the worst yearly drop exceeding 40% and an average decline of over 11%. This data suggests that stock prices are significantly more volatile than the cash flows from dividends.Story continuesSome of the best stocks to buy for income include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the investment strategy and the performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dogs of the Dow Stocks Ranked By Hedge Fund Sentiment.\xa0The Dogs of the Dow strategy is an investment approach that involves selecting and investing in the top 10 dividend-yielding stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) on an annual basis. The strategy assumes that these high-yield stocks, or ""Dogs,"" are temporarily undervalued or out of favor, and by investing in them, investors can benefit from potential price appreciation while receiving a steady income from dividends. Many financial experts have explained the strategy thoroughly to help investors gain a deep understanding of it. Robert R. Johnson, professor of finance at the Heider College of Business at Creighton University, spoke about the Dogs in one of his interviews with Business Insider. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The underlying premise behind the strategy is mean reversion. The [Dogs of the Dow] is based on the theory that stocks can be over or undervalued, but over the long run those that are undervalued will \'revert to the mean.”Over time, the Dogs of the Dow strategy has been a good way for investors to make money, especially during slow economic growth. Various reports have pointed out the strong performance of this strategy over time, which has increased investors\' trust in it. In one of our articles on the topic, we referred to the Wall Street Journal’s report which said that the strategy returned 34.3% in 2013 through December 26, outperforming the Dow, which gained 28.9% during that time. The report also noted that this strategy outperformed the market for a significant part of the 1970s and 1980s. Over the long term, the strategy has also done better than its standard benchmark. According to Forbes, from 1957 to 2003, the Dogs outperformed the broader index by 3%.Story continuesOn average, since 2010, the Dogs of the Dow have shown returns that are very similar to the broader market index. Robert R. Johnson has commented on the recent performance of the strategy.""While they have produced similar returns over that 12-year period, some individual years have seen quite a divergence in performance. In 2020, for example, the DJIA gained 7.2% while the Dogs suffered a loss of 12.7%. The Dogs also underperformed in 2021, when the Dogs generated a return of 16.3% versus 20.8% for the DJIA.""The report also compared the Dogs’ returns with that of the S&P 500. The report revealed that the Dogs had an average annual return of 13.6%, while the S&P 500 had 13.9% per year, generating nearly similar returns during this period. Some of the best stocks from the category include JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) as these stocks have high yields. In this article, we will discuss the best Dogs of the Dow according to hedge funds.Best Dogs of the Dow Stocks Ranked By Hedge Fund SentimentPhoto by Karolina Grabowska from PexelsOur Methodology:We started with a list of 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and selected dividend-paying stocks from that list.

Mike?Story continuesMichael Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, we built momentum through strong operational execution as we again delivered for our customers, positioning us for a solid close to 2023. On an adjusted basis, we delivered earnings ahead of our expectations, expanded margins sequentially across all four businesses, and achieved our third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth in free cash flow. As we make progress and deliver improved financial results, we are increasing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $8.95 to $9.15, up from a previous range of $8.60 to $9.10, and our adjusted free cash flow conversion range to 100% to 110%, up from 90% to 100% previously.We continue to deliver against our priorities. We are driving performance throughout 3M with strong operational execution, restructuring actions, and spending discipline. We are progressing the spin of the healthcare business, which we expect to be completed during the first half of 2024. And we are reducing risk and uncertainty by reaching significant settlements to address combat arms and PFAS litigation. I will now provide some additional context around how we are advancing these priorities. Next slide, please. Our margin expansion clearly demonstrates the performance our team is driving throughout 3M. We delivered 240 basis points of year-over-year adjusted operating income margin expansion, excluding 80 basis points of restructuring-related charges.We are strengthening our business in several important ways. We are progressing with our restructuring actions to streamline our organization, reduce structural costs, and get us closer to customers. We have leaned out the center of our Company, simplified our global supply chain organization, and optimized our global go-to-market models. At the same time, we are advancing supply chain performance to improve service, drive productivity and yield, expand gross margins, and increase cash conversion. These results are being supported by initiatives that use our continuous improvement toolkit and leverage data and data analytics. For example, we have benefited from more than 60 Kaizen events this year to improve existing processes in our largest plants.We are also progressing the spin of our healthcare business, building the leadership team as we work toward completing the spin in the first half of 2024. During the quarter, we added two experienced leaders, naming Bryan Hanson as the CEO of the Standalone Healthcare Business and Kerry Cox as the Board Chair. Finally, we continue to manage risk and uncertainty by proactively and effectively managing litigation. We announced the combat arms settlement, and we are working with all parties and the courts to implement it. The settlement administration process has been established and funded. The bellwether trial verdicts have been settled, and the process for notifying and settling with claimants has begun. With respect to PFAS, the public water supplier settlement we announced last quarter has received preliminary court approval.We successfully resolved objections from state attorneys general and are working toward approval with the final hearing set for early February next year. In closing, I want to share a few thoughts about our future. Our momentum accelerates our ability to define where we go next at 3M. As we prioritize attractive markets, where we have the right to win, and the opportunity to differentiate ourselves through our unique capabilities and strengths; a good example is our automotive OEM business, where we continue to outperform the market with double-digit growth this quarter. Auto electrification is on track to be a $600 million business this year and has delivered organic growth of 30% year to date. Our material science expertise has led us to build a new business, and we see similar opportunities in other core platforms such as safety, home improvement, and consumer electronics.We are also prioritizing emerging global trends that have attractive growth rates and customer needs that match up well with 3M capabilities. We are building new platforms in areas like climate technology, industrial automation, and next-generation electronics. Before I hand it over to Monish for additional insight into our performance, a few closing thoughts. I am pleased with the way our teams are executing. They delivered third-quarter results that build on the momentum we saw in the second quarter, setting us up for a solid close to 2023. We are advancing our priorities, driving performance, progressing our healthcare spin, and reducing risk and uncertainty. 3M is delivering today lower costs, better margins, and greater cash generation and building for tomorrow, prioritizing growth platforms, innovating with impact, and empowering our teams.I will now turn it over to Monish for more details on the third quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Monish?Monish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to slide five. As Mike mentioned, we are seeing significant traction from the actions we are taking to strengthen the business. Through a focus on customers, effective adjustment of production, benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives, ongoing proactive spending discipline, and the relentless focus on managing inventory, we were able to deliver solid adjusted third-quarter results, including sales of $8 billion at the high-end of our guidance range of $7.9 billion to $8 billion, operating margins of 23.2%, an increase of 160 basis points year-on-year and 390 basis points sequentially; earnings per share of $2.68, a year-on-year increase of 3%, and free cash flow of $1.9 billion, up 39% year-on-year with conversion of 130%.Organic sales on an adjusted basis declined 3.1% versus last year. This included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million, or 1.7 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand and last year's exit of our operations in Russia. Excluding this, Q3 adjusted organic sales were down 1.4%. Consumer and electronics end markets continue to be soft. Our adjusted organic sales declined year-on-year mid-single digits in our electronics business and high-single digits in consumer. This softness was partially offset by strength in our automotive OEM business. Regionally, the U.S. was up slightly despite continued challenges in retail. Europe remained soft, and China was down mid-teens year-on-year organically due to continued end-market softness along with lapping strong sales backlog recovery in the prior year.Our strong adjusted EPS of $2.68, exceeded our expectations of $2.25 to $2.40. Roughly two-thirds of the beat was driven by operational execution in our supply chain and proactive spending discipline, and a balance driven by restructuring timing. The restructuring actions we announced earlier this year are largely on track and we are seeing favorable margin impact in our results. We continue to expect full year pre-tax restructuring benefits of $400 million to $450 million with offsetting charges. Turning to slide six for the components that drove our year-on-year operating margin and earnings performance, manufacturing productivity and restructuring actions, strong spending discipline, and selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume, investments in the business, and the previously mentioned headwind from disposable respirator and last year's exit of Russia, resulted an improvement to operating margins of 260 basis points and to earnings of $0.22 per share.Pre-tax restructuring and related charges in the quarter were $68 million or a negative impact to margins of 80 basis points and $0.10 to earnings. This charge was lower than our anticipated range of $125 million to $175 million in Q3 due to factors that impacted the timing of actions that are being pushed into Q4. The carryover impact of higher raw material logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $25 million, or a negative 30 basis points impact to operating margins and $0.03 to earnings. Foreign currency translation was a positive 0.6% impact to total adjusted sales. This resulted in a $0.01 tailwind to earnings per share. Last year's food safety divestiture and the reconsolidation of aero technologies resulted in a net year-on-year tailwind of 10 basis points to margins and no impact to earnings.Finally, other financial items decreased earnings by a net $0.02 per share year-on-year. In summary, our team's focus on driving productivity, executing restructuring actions, and controlling spending continues to yield results. These actions drove meaningful year-on-year and sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins. Please turn to slide seven. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up 39% year-on-year, with a conversion of 130%, up 360 basis points, versus last year's Q3. This year-on-year improvement was driven by an ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory. Inventory was down over $200 million sequentially and $550 million year-on-year as we benefit from the power of daily management and data and data analytics to speed up inventory terms.As always, there is more we can do and will do to continue to realize benefits from our actions as we move forward. Adjusted capital expenditures were $367 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in growth, productivity, and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividends. Net debt at the end of Q3 stood at $10.8 billion, a reduction of 11% year-on-year. Our business segments continue their long history of robust cash flow generation. In addition, our proven access to capital markets, along with the anticipated one-time dividend from the spin of health care at leverage of three to three and a half times EBITDA and 19.9% retained stake will provide additional financial flexibility. This, combined with our existing strong capital structure, provides us with the ability to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders, and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters.Now, please turn to slide nine for our business group performance. Starting with our safety and industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 5.8% organically, this result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $130 million, or 4.3 percentage points, due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator decline and exit of our operations in Russia. Excluding this, Q3 adjusted organic sales were down 1.5%. Personal safety was down high single digits due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator comp. Excluding disposable respirators, personal safety was up high single digits organically. Closure and masking continued to be impacted by lower packaging and shipping activity, and industrial adhesive and tapes by end-market softness in electronics.Abrasives, electrical markets, and automotive aftermarket declined versus last year's strong comparisons. And finally, organic growth in our roofing granules business was up high single digits. Adjusted operating income was $708 million or up 5% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 25.7%, up 250 basis points year-on-year and up 350 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year improvement in margins was mainly driven by ongoing productivity actions, restructuring benefits, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume and restructuring costs. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 10, which posted Q3 adjusted sales of $1.9 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 1.8% year-on-year, largely due to expected weakness in electronics.Our electronics business experienced a year-on-year mid-single-digit decline in adjusted organic sales as semiconductor and data center end market demand continues to remain soft. We are starting to see signs of stabilization in consumer electronics end market. However, we are closely monitoring demand trends as we head into the upcoming holiday season. Our auto OEM business had a strong quarter, increasing approximately 16% year-on-year versus a low single-digit global car and light truck build, as we continue to gain penetration on automotive platforms. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics, commercial solutions and transportation safety both declined mid-single digits year-on-year, mainly driven by weakness in China, while Advanced Materials grew low single digits.Transportation and Electronics delivered $494 million in adjusted operating income, up 21% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 26.3%, up 460 basis points year-on-year and up 650 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, restructuring benefits, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volumes and restructuring costs. Looking at our health care business on Slide 11, Q3 sales were $2.1 billion, with organic growth up 2.4% versus last year. Organic sales in oral care were up high single digits year-on-year and medical solutions grew low single digits organically, including continued impact from lower post-COVID-related bio-pharma demand.Health Information Systems declined low single digits due to tighter hospital budgets. As procedure volumes continue to improve and hospital budgets stabilize, we are confident in the long-term outlook of this business. Health Care's third quarter operating income was $460 million or up 2% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22.2%, up 50 basis points year-on-year and up sequentially 240 basis points. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, restructuring benefits strong spending discipline and price. These benefits were partially offset by restructuring costs. Finally, on Slide 12, our Consumer business posted third quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 7.2% year-on-year as discretionary spending trends on hard-line categories remains subdued.The back-to-school season was soft and rising interest rates continue to impact the housing market and related spending. Consumers' third quarter operating income was $269 million, down 10% compared to last year with operating margins of 20.5%, down 70 basis points year-on-year, however, were up 230 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year decline in margins was driven by headwinds from lower sales volumes and restructuring costs. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from productivity actions, restructuring and strong spending discipline and price. That concludes our remarks on the third quarter. Please turn to Slide 14 for an update on our full year's expectations. Our strong third quarter performance shows the results of the significant actions we have put in place this year to generate better productivity yield and efficiency from our supply chain, drive simplification, manage costs and deliver for our customers in an uncertain macro environment.As a result, we are raising our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow conversion guidance. We now expect full year adjusted earnings in the range of $8.95 to $9.15 versus our prior range of $8.60 to $9.10. We are also updating our full year adjusted free cash flow conversion to be in a forecasted range of 100% to 110% versus 90% to 100% previously. Based on our year-to-date performance, we expect full year adjusted organic growth to be down approximately 3% versus our prior guidance to be at the lower end of flat to minus 3%. This updated expectation includes an incremental headwind of $50 million from continued softness in disposable respirator demand. We now estimate a full year sales decline for disposable respirators of approximately $600 million versus $550 million previously.Looking ahead to the implied fourth quarter, we expect end market trends to be consistent with Q3. Hence, we anticipate fourth quarter adjusted sales to be in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion, taking into consideration normal seasonality with fewer sales days due to holidays. Fourth quarter pre-tax restructuring charges are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $120 million, incorporating the timing impact I mentioned earlier, with pre-tax benefits of $145 million to $195 million. Taken together, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.33. To wrap up, we are very focused on our priorities by driving improved performance through strong operational execution, progressing on our restructuring actions and spending discipline successfully spinning off health care and reducing risk by managing litigation exposures.At the same time, we are positioning 3M for the future as we prioritize the most attractive markets, invest to support continued innovation and capitalize on emerging opportunities. We expect our actions will continue to build momentum and drive long-term improvement in our organic growth margins and cash flow performance into the future. As we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and a more focused 3M, and I remain confident in our future. Our solid third quarter is a direct result of the hard work of 3M employees. I want to thank them for their dedication and focus as they continue to deliver in partnership with our suppliers for customers and shareholders. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.See also 12 Best Telecom Stocks To Buy Right Now and 10 Fastest Growing Auto Stocks to Buy.Q&A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question.Scott Davis: Good morning, Mike, Monish, and Bruce. I haven't been able to say this in a while, but a pretty solid, complete quarter overall, so some progress there. But, guys, I want to back up a little bit. What are the remaining steps to get health care spin complete? Any big hurdles still remaining?Michael Roman: Yes, Scott, I would say the team continues to make very good progress. And so we don't see any hurdles ahead of us. There's a lot of work to do to get ready for the spin and so we've got work to do, getting ready for each step of that process. As we talked about in my remarks, we named the CEO, and we're adding to the leadership team and getting that built out. So that's really an important foundation. We have the Board Chair named and continue to work on filling out the Board. So those are important steps. I don't see -- the team has given us great confidence that we're going to continue to progress. And we're on track for the timing that we talked about in early 2024 and see ourselves getting there successfully.Importantly, for us, it's -- much of it is and we've talked about, it's about getting ready for the spin of health care, it's also about getting ready to stand up 3M as a stand-alone Company with a health care spin being completed. So we're putting focus there. And even what we talked about in the quarter that really driving the priorities that we are talking about, the execution in our operational execution is an important part of getting ready for 3M for the spin as well, and we're making good progress there, as you noted.Monish Patolawala: Just process-wise to add to Mike's comments, the teams are working through system changes, standing up legal entities and as well as all the regulatory filings, Scott, that we need to do, and that's what everyone is focused on from the health care side.Scott Davis: That's helpful. So Mike, just taking your comments a little further, at the new 3M, do you envision a new 3M or you can kind of run at lower levels of CapEx, lower levels of even potentially R&D as a percent of sales. And the knock on 3M was always that it costs a lot of money to drive a point of growth and sometimes with the incrementals that worked out well. But in down cycles, that certainly did not work out well. But is there a new vision in 3M, I should say, that you can run at kind of more productive, efficient levels of CapEx and R&D?Michael Roman: Yes. Scott, there's a couple of dimensions to the answer to your question. The first starts with what we've been talking about. We announced a restructuring back in Q1, and that was really coming from what we had learned as we operated our businesses and we looked at where we were going with our supply chains in the face of some of the challenges in supply chains globally. And it was really behind that was an expectation that we could drive greater productivity, improvement in our execution, stronger performance, improved margins. And so that was really the foundation of that restructuring. And so I think part of the answer to your question is we took those decisions to lean out the center of the Company, simplify our supply chain, streamline our go-to-market models.Those are a foundation for the future of 3M. And those are -- you can see starting to demonstrate that we can drive improved financial performance for the Company. And that's -- we expect that to be a foundation for the future as well. I even talked about this is with that performance starting to build some momentum, we can accelerate how we view the future. And then you are talking about investing in growth and innovation and productivity and sustainability. And we'll continue to be our capital allocation, first priority is going to be investing in organic growth in R&D and CapEx. And really, thinking of and targeting high-growth market spaces, places where we can differentiate ourselves with our innovation capabilities where we can be aligned to emerging market trends.So I think that how we prioritize that investment is going to be aligned with where we see that ability to make a difference. So both are important foundations for the future.Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.Andrew Obin: Yes. Good morning. Just a question on electronics. It's been a headwind for a while. What KPIs are you looking at? When do you think -- and I think you said that was broadly in line with expectations. But when do you see the light at the end of the tunnel? When does it bottom -- what does it take for this business to bottom?Michael Roman: Yes, Andrew, I would say we came through third quarter. We still saw as we said soft end markets for electronics, and that's consumer electronics, it's into semiconductor. It's into a big part of our -- what we have as a focus in our customers and electronics. When we look ahead, there's some uncertainty, we're starting to see, as Monish said, electronics stabilize. I think that really reflects that we don't see it continuing to go down. It's starting to stabilize. There's some -- companies are talking about things getting better as they go forward. I would say we're watching it closely. We expect Q4 to look a lot like Q3 in our end markets, and I would say electronics included. So we're watching what we always watch.Our customers are large electronics customers in consumer electronics and semiconductor associated with data centers and those are the -- that's where we're going to be taking the lead from where we see demand going, where we see market performance going, when we see the market improve. We'll take the lead from them.Monish Patolawala: Just another data point for you, Andrew, at the end of second quarter, we had said that the way we predicted electronics was the amount of negative Vs quarter-on-quarter would get better. So if you compare us to the first half and the amount we were down year-on-year versus the third quarter, we are less down. It doesn't mean we are not down, but that's another point that Mike was trying to make is that's where we are starting to see some signs of stabilization. But as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we'll have to just watch how the holiday season plays out.Andrew Obin: Got you. And just a follow-up question on health care. I appreciate that you guys are doing a lot of sort of sort of accounting, et cetera, et cetera. But you have done the separations in the past. And I guess the question I have, any thoughts, as Bryan has joined the Company, I know in the past, there's been headlines about Health Information System being separated. I know there are other sort of businesses inside health care. Any thought about sort of maybe repositioning the portfolio as particularly as Bryan came on board, repositioned the portfolio for sort of future as a stand-alone Company.Michael Roman: Yes, Andrew, going back to really how did we think about the strategy to spin out health care. And one of the important questions was do we see health care as a leading health care technology Company attractive to shareholders with a great future. And that portfolio of businesses, the answer for us was yes. And that the -- the best way to create that value was to stand it up as a stand-alone Company and the portfolio work we had done even over time as part of 3M position it to be a successful stand-alone Company. And each of the businesses play an important role there. Now it is going to be an independent Company. We'll have a new CEO and a Board and they will develop the strategies for how they think about creating the greatest value driving growth for that business, thinking about how to really manage that portfolio of businesses as they go forward.So we see it as being ready to stand forward as a leader and are really confident in the leadership that will take the Company as a stand-alone.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.Joseph Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can we start just on the restructuring, the benefits and the push out a little bit of the expenses? Just -- it seems like you're running ahead of schedule on the benefits. So I'd love to get any color about where this is. What you see coming in better than expected? And then also just on the push-out on the cost into 4Q, just what were some of the reasons for why the costs are getting pushed out from 3Q to 4Q?Monish Patolawala: Yes. So I'll just start, again, as a reminder, Joe, the total benefits for this program over the period of the program is $700 million to $900 million, with costs approximately of $700 million to $900 million. And coming into the year, we had said for 2023, we would see benefits in the ranges of $400 million to $450 million of benefits and equal offsetting charges. So when you look year-to-date, we are, I would say largely on track for the year, we still believe will be in the $400 million to $450 million of benefits, which will get offset by cost of $400 million to $450 million. So the teams have done a really nice job of continuing to execute. There are multiple pieces to this program. One was corporate simplification.The second was streamlining our supply chain. And third was making sure that we are closer to our customers in our business group units. And all three of these programs are running well on track. As regards to just timing from Q3 to Q4, I would say nothing big. We operate in multiple countries, as you know, and we wanted to make sure we follow all rules and regulations in those countries. And so some items dropped from Q3 to Q4, and we had a couple of other small investments that we had to make in Q3. They're just based on all the work the teams are doing, we just felt better to do it in Q4, so nothing major. So still pretty much largely on track, $400 million to $450 million of benefits for the year and $700 million to $900 million for the program.Joseph Ritchie: Got it. Okay. Great. That's helpful, Monish. And then I guess -- I know it's probably too early to think about 2024. But if you kind of think through like the price/cost equation from here on out, it seems like raw materials are becoming less and less of a headwind for you guys. Can you maybe just provide any type of framework for 2024 and ultimately, like how you think about both price and what you're seeing from a raw mat perspective?Monish Patolawala: So, I'll just start first, Joe, by 2024 is a little ways away. So I think our first focus is just getting Q4 done, getting the teams continuing to focus on our priorities. You've seen what our teams have done. So we continue to execute on our priorities. You've seen we have delivered a solid Q3. We have taken guidance up for the whole year. We're gaining momentum, and we want the team to continue to focus on doing that getting 2023 closed out. So when we get into 2024 and Q4 2023 earnings call, we'll definitely give you an update on 2024. To answer your question on deflation and price, I'll start with deflation. I'll start by saying, first of all, the headwinds that we have seen or the carryover headwinds are approximately $25 million in the quarter, which we called out, which was very similar to Q2.When you look at overall market and material, I would say we are seeing more disinflation than deflation. When you think about places where energy is still a little more -- is still inflationary, downstream materials are still inflationary and then labor is still sticky from an inflation perspective. Where we have seen some benefits is upstream chemicals and logistics and the teams have taken advantage of that. But I would say more importantly, I don't think the teams are just focused on material cost, they are more focused on saying, how do we drive overall cost down in the factories, whether it is driving yield and efficiency, whether it is dual sourcing, whether it is making sure we have alternate materials. That's what Peter Gibbons and the team is working.And the work that they have done through this year is clearly evident in the results that you're seeing. So that team has done a very nice job. And then when it comes to price, I would tell you, we came into the quarter -- into the year, we said low single digits price increase. That's what we are -- as of right now, we are on track with pretty much the same range. And Joe, as you know, you've followed 3M longer than I have. This is not a formula-based pricing. We are very thoughtful about it. We look at it market by market, product by product, and we make sure that the price that we are charging our customers is a representation of the value that we -- that our customers get. And I would say, if you leave 2024 aside for a moment, long term, 3M has always had a very good price/cost equation because of the value that we add to our customers.And I don't see that changing. And I believe that with the innovation that we bring with the customer focus that we have that, that equation remains.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. You may proceed with your question.Christopher Snyder: Thank you. One thing that has really stood out to us over the last couple of quarters is the underlying margin improvement of the business. if we ex out restructuring spend and savings, we see an operating margin on the underlying business of roughly 22% this quarter, first, less than 21% in Q2 and like a mid-'18 in Q1. So a very strong ramp here. Can you just talk about what's driving that outside of the restructuring, why is the underlying business seeing so much margin momentum?Monish Patolawala: So I would say, first, Chris, it's a huge thanks to the 3Mers who have been focused on their priorities. The priorities, as Mike mentioned, driving performance across all of 3M, spinning out health care, reducing risk by managing litigation is all starting to show up in the results. To your point, even if you exclude our restructuring costs and benefits, the margin rate is -- has shown a pretty good ramp. And that's driven, I would say, by two or three things. One is continued execution in the supply chain, with some of the restructuring that we have made and the supply chain is definitely more agile. We are also using a lot of data and data analytics. We have also learned through the pandemic on how to continue to operate our supply chain.So number one, you're starting to see the benefit of the improved yield and efficiency, you're able to take longer runs to as material gets better. Secondly, the team has been very thoughtful in proactive cost management to the extent where they saw there were places they could invest, they have; to the extent where we had lower volumes, we have managed to control cost. Third is we have had a relentless focus on working capital with inventory, and you're seeing that from a cash conversion basis. So I would just say it's continued good, strong operating performance that you're starting to see. And then as you add on the benefits that you get from the restructuring and once the cost goes away, which we have said this program will take approximately two years to complete out, you can see the overall, long-term benefits from the margin rate that you're going to get from better operating performance as well as better restructuring benefits.At the same time, you've got to keep in mind that we are that -- the teams are going to continue to watch this in the fourth quarter. It's an uncertain macro. But I'm very confident with what we're doing that the execution is there, but there's always more we can do, and we'll keep trying to drive more and more execution as we go.Christopher Snyder: I appreciate that. And maybe kind of taking that and bridging to the Q4 guide. It seems to us by our math, that you're kind of guiding underlying operating margins ex restructuring to something like 19% down from the almost 22% this quarter. I know revenue is down, but it seems to suggest a very sharp decremental. Can you just maybe talk about what's causing that margin step down? Because it feels like a lot of the improvements, whether it's supply chain or price cost are sustainable. Thank you.Monish Patolawala: Yes. Chris, again, depends on the math. I'll just start with margin rates in total. When we started the year or we came into the year, we had said margin rates for the year are going to be around 19%. At the end of Q2, we said margin rates are going between 19.5% to 20% for the year. And now based on where we are with the midpoint of our guide, our margin rate will be approximately 20%. So when you back into it, the fourth quarter is higher than the 19.5% that you have, it's somewhere in that 20.5% to 21% for the fourth quarter. And just to keep in mind, the reason you see this decremental. One is, of course, the restructuring is higher in Q4 versus Q3, plus it's higher of -- the midpoint is $95 million to $100 million of restructuring on a year-over-year basis, if you're doing year-over-year decrementals.The second piece to keep in mind is, in general, revenue in 3M drops from Q3 to Q4, you have less billing days or less business days in Q4. That's why our revenue guide, which is going from $8 billion, it goes down to between $7.6 billion and $7.7 billion, which is basically saying the underlying macro trends are the same. It's just lower billing days or lower business days, which also puts an impact. If you look at the history of 3M, Chris, and you look at Q3 to Q4, you will always see a pretty sharp decline from Q3 to Q4 in margin rate. And that's mainly driven by just the lower volume because of the less business days that come into Q4. Hopefully, that answered your question.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Andrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys. So, Monish, I think at a conference a month ago, you had lowered your revenue guidance a bit and you sort of report $8 billion -- I think you had $7.9 billion to $8 billion. So maybe you can talk about the cadence of revenues for the quarter. Did any of your businesses pick up in September here in October? Are you just being conservative at the time? And then how are you thinking about the impact of higher rates on your businesses?Monish Patolawala: So I'll start by saying at that moment in time, what we saw is what we told you all, which we felt was in that $7.9 billion to $8 billion. There Was uncertainty in electronics, consumer and China, I would say, thanks to all the focus the teams have on taking care of customers, we were able to get to the high end of our range of $8 billion. I would say the same trends, Andy, pretty much stayed through the quarter. Electronics pretty much was where we thought it was going to be. China continued to remain weak and so did consumer retail. As Mike mentioned and so I have in my prepared remarks, we are seeing electronic stabilizing. We are watching for the fourth quarter what the holiday trends will bring for consumer retail.Back-to-school was softer than we expected. And then China, again, I would say is we are -- it's pretty much the trends we expected in China. Overall, for the fourth quarter, you'll see us having revenue of $7.6 billion to $7.7 million, which is again just driven by the fact you have less business days. On the other side, if you look at margin and you look at what the teams have done, the teams have continued to be very good on an operating execution perspective. We have continued to drive proactive cost control. We've done that in Q3. We'll continue to do that in Q4. And as a result, we were able to beat the 225 to 240. I had said in that conference a few months ago, and then we have raised totally a guide from 860 to 910 to 895 to 915. And then the other point, Andy, that's another bright spot is the cash conversion.The teams have done a marvelous job managing inventory, 130% free cash flow conversion in the third quarter, which has allowed us to raise our total year guide of free cash flow -- adjusted free cash flow conversion from 200% to 110% from 90% to 100%. So overall, the team is focused on operating execution.Andrew Kaplowitz: Monish, if I can follow up on that, the cash conversion target raise. Maybe talk about your efforts. I know you talked about improving digitization at the Company, it seems like you're focused on digitization inventories having impact. So maybe you can talk about the confidence in generating higher cash conversion going forward, sort of the duration of these improvements as you go forward in '24 and beyond.Monish Patolawala: Yes. From the day of coming here, Andy, I've said working capital is a great opportunity for 3M. And through the pandemic, unfortunately, we had to build inventory levels and most companies did just to make sure we took care of our customers. And our first priority was always to take care of our customers. So we made sure we had enough inventory. As two things, as supply chains are stabilizing, number one, but more importantly, the execution that the teams are doing using data and data analytics and not -- and what I mean by that is not just going and using analytics, but being able to visualize by looking at data, they are able to see where the inventory is better. They are able to get a better demand signal, which allows them to get a better manufacturing signal, which allows them to get a better supply signal to their suppliers.And then the third piece is with all the work that we have done through the restructuring, where we have got the supply chain streamlined and restructured so that it's more agile. All of that is playing itself out in the inventory that we are seeing. I would tell you, as I said in my prepared remarks, there's more to go here. There's more that we can keep driving in this space. And we are going to continue driving it because this is a great place where we can continue to generate very strong cash for 3M.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. What are you planning and assuming for the auto strike impact for 4Q?Michael Roman: Yes, Deane, so it's something we're watching very closely. We're -- as you know, we stay very close with the automotive OEMs, our key customers there. We are -- we haven't seen a significant impact on our business to date. And we continue to watch it closely. We're staying connected on what happens week-to-week and impacting our demand. But it's something that as part of -- an important part of our global automotive business, the automotive as we talked about in the quarter, had very good performance. We had 16% growth in the quarter, outgrowing build rates and that's the broader core of our automotive business, our auto electrification business is growing even faster. So it's an important part. It's had some impact but relatively small impact to this point. Again, we're watching it closely as we move ahead.Deane Dray: Got it. And then you mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, the back-to-school sales were weak. Can you quantify that just maybe year-over-year? And then how does this set up for holiday sales with consumer being weak, higher rates? What's the assumption there as well?Michael Roman: Yes, Dean, I probably would point you back at some of the data out there about year-over-year spend back-to-school being down per student. There's a number of metrics out there. For us, our category broadly in consumer is exposed to like shifting discretionary spend. So that continues to be part of the consumer story. So it wasn't back-to-school story, only back-to-school was muted. We didn't see the strong replenishment cycles that we would have seen in a stronger back-to-school. So I think we confirmed the data that's out there. And as we look ahead, we're -- I would say we're just looking at the uncertainty around what happens for the holiday season as well. And so we'll be monitoring that. And again, there's a broader story around consumer, retail for us, the shift of spending from discretionary products into areas like food and I would say, experienced kinds of spending, that trend has continued.So those are both underlying some of the performance that we saw in consumer in the quarter and how we're thinking about it into Q4.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.Stephen Tusa: Hi, good morning. Could you just give just an update total expected now inflation kind of carryover for the year? I know you mentioned it in the second quarter. Is that unchanged relative to what you had said before? I think it was like $150 million? Maybe that changed?Monish Patolawala: No change, Steve.Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then I guess, low single digits for the year on pricing. So that's kind of like a mid-single-digit volume decline. That kind of feels already recessionary. Things seem like very stable for you guys revenue-wise. How much of that negative 5% do you think is a function of destocking versus trend line on demand? And then just one last one for the fourth quarter. How much of that sequential sales decline are you expecting from electronics seasonality?Michael Roman: Yes. So Steve, maybe just thinking about the -- take the channel dynamic first, if you want. I would say -- when we look across the channel where we're seeing some destocking as in industrial channels, and that's really -- I think we talked about that last quarter, too, as supply chain performance has improved and stabilized. We're seeing the industrial channels shorten up their replenishment cycles. And so they're managing their inventory maybe back to more normal levels prior to when we got hit with some of the supply chain disruption. So that's the one destocking effect. There is some destocking in consumer that played out. The biggest part of that played out over the last year, retailers focused pretty heavily on taking out inventory.That seems to have played out, although there's some of that with the soft demand that's continuing. So it's, I would say, the rest of it -- when I look across the channel, otherwise, it's pretty stable globally; maybe some adjustments in China in some of those same markets as we continue to see the macro looking for where the macro goes as we go forward. Looking as we move ahead, electronics, we talked about stabilizing. It's really, Monish pointed out, it's part of it's a year-over-year comp. Remember last year, third and fourth quarter, we saw a decline in the electronics end markets, and we saw that in our businesses. So that's part of the view that Q4 stabilizes that year-over-year comp gets a little more -- changes a little bit as we lap some of those earlier declines from the first half.So I would say, we're staying close to that holiday season and what happens. That's an important season for electronics, and we'll be watching that closely as we go into the quarter.Monish Patolawala: Steve, I'll just add. I'll just add -- I just wanted to add one more disposable respirators is down $600 million on a year-over-year basis. That's approximately 200 basis points of growth.Stephen Tusa: Right. So sorry, are you assuming kind of normal sequential seasonal decline in electronics, you are?Michael Roman: Yes. Well, in the broader business, we have seasonality. Some of that is normal end market cycles, but it's also billing days as well. We have the holiday season. So we see it sequentially from Q3 to Q4, we see that normal trend.Stephen Tusa: Right, which you've always had, of courseOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.Nigel Coe: Hi, good morning guys. So you can have too many electronics questions. So what's got my attention in Electronics is the sequential growth from 1Q through to 3Q has been quite sharp. I think 1Q was about 680. I think 3Q is a 750 or so. I mean I know some of its seasonality, et cetera. But it must give you a lot of confidence that as we go into 2024, that at least in the first half of the year, we should be -- that should be a nice tailwind to the business. So any thoughts on that?Michael Roman: Well, Nigel, I would say it's going to depend on the outlook as we get to 2024 for electronics and those key end markets that you're talking about it. And we've seen -- maybe that's part of the stabilization that we're seeing is the quarterly trend in electronics and against that year-over-year comparable is stabilizing in the second half. What will decide the performance in first quarter or first half of next year will really depend on the demand that we see. And some of that will come through the holiday season, but we'll be -- we'll come back at our Q4 earnings call and update on how we're looking at the first half of next year.Nigel Coe: Okay. That's great. And then I don't like to ask same macro questions necessarily, but you are pretty -- cycle, very channel-centric. The flash PMI for the U.S. was at 50 in October. Are you seeing more stabilization or maybe some sequential improvement in the U.S. relative to Europe and China?Michael Roman: Yes. I think Monish called out the performance in the U.S. was up slightly, and -- and that, I would say, mixed performance in our industrial businesses in the U.S., reflecting some areas of strength, but also some, I would say, caution and uncertainty around the broader economy. So I think we're seeing the U.S. performing a little better, up slightly. And that's -- I would say that's in spite of the challenges that we've been talking about in consumer retail. So Safety and Industrial posted, I think, mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. in the quarter. So that's a good reflection on what we're seeing more broadly. And maybe that PMI is aligned to that. That PMI represents kind of a middle kind of expectation from the purchasing managersMonish Patolawala: Just only other thing Nigel I will add to Mike's comments is just in certain pockets, we are seeing customers managing inventory channel. And part of it is supply chains are definitely far more stable. So customers have lower lead times, so they're managing that in pockets.Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning, thank you very much. One quick question. I just wanted to circle back on your sort of pricing outlook as you see it because volumes have been soft for some time. Headline inflation in theory is easing. Traditionally, you do have price pressure in areas like electronics, just through nature of the industry. So I just wondered sort of what the comfort level was as you look into Q4 and early next year, that you can hold price kind of firm-wide at least flat at 3M? And whether there's been any change how you sort of go to market to push price just given the experience of inflation in the last couple of years?Monish Patolawala: Yes, Julian, I would just say the same thing that I said with another question before. The way I would just say long term, 3M has always been able to add value to its customers, and that is reflected in the pricing that it charges. We look at this not based on just a formula, but we look at it market by market, look at our competitive position and market by market, look at the value we add, and that's how we come up with our pricing that we go with. And I would say, based on the innovation and the value that we add to our customers, long term, I don't see that changing. In the short run, as you have seen, the Company has been able to manage inflation through price. And if needed, we'll continue doing that. But overall, right now, the teams are quite focused on delivering the fourth quarter, and then we'll see where long term goes this topic. It will be a function of demand, a function of inflation. So that's the way I look at it.Julian Mitchell: Understood. And then just to focus on a couple of markets within Safety and Industrial, but I guess had been pretty strong and most of the sort of rhetoric is fairly strong around them. But organically, you had a little bit of pressure at least or less growth in and that's the electrical markets and also automotive aftermarket. So I just wondered any color around those in terms of is it just kind of accelerated destocking distributors just holding off on orders for some reason? Any color at all on auto aftermarket and electrical?Michael Roman: Yes, Julian, I wouldn't -- we saw a little bit of destocking in electrical markets. That was one of the areas in industrial that we saw that impacting. And I would say our automotive aftermarket probably saw a little bit of adjustments given what we talked about and Monish highlighted that, improving supply chains, distribution and the channel are managing their inventories, their safety stock, so more in line with stable supply chain. So I think that's part of it. Those have both been seeing good market performance as we've gone through the year. I think again, we're watching closely the trends as we go into the end of the year. But really, it's, I think, reflects on the -- a little bit of destocking and also the end market demand.Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.Michael Roman: To wrap up, we continue to execute our strategies, delivering results in a challenging environment while positioning 3M for the future, prioritizing high-growth markets and geographies where 3M innovation can deliver the most impact. Thank you for joining us.Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

ABT,"['ABTeditorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)November 4, 2023 at 4:00 AM·6 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowABTWatchlistKey InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Abbott Laboratories fair value estimate is US$113Abbott Laboratories\' US$95.84 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Analyst price target for ABT is US$116, which is 3.1% above our fair value estimateToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today\'s value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Abbott Laboratories The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second \'steady growth\' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today\'s dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.42bUS$8.72bUS$8.97bUS$9.40bUS$9.70bUS$9.99bUS$10.3bUS$10.5bUS$10.8bUS$11.0bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.20%Est @ 2.90%Est @ 2.70%Est @ 2.55%Est @ 2.45%Est @ 2.38% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$7.9kUS$7.6kUS$7.4kUS$7.2kUS$7.0kUS$6.7kUS$6.5kUS$6.2kUS$6.0kUS$5.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$68bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business\'s cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country\'s GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year \'growth\' period, we discount future cash flows to today\'s value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.2%) = US$246bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$246b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$128bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$196b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$95.8, the company appears about fair value at a 15% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don\'t have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company\'s future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company\'s potential performance. Given that we are looking at Abbott Laboratories as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we\'ve used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.916. Beta is a measure of a stock\'s volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Abbott LaboratoriesStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won\'t be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It\'s not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

NARI delivered earnings per share (EPS) of 5 cents in the third quarter of 2023 against the year-ago period’s loss of 19 cents per share. However, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a breakeven EPS.Revenues in DetailInari Medical registered revenues of $126.4 million in the third quarter, up 31.4% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6%.Q3 HighlightsOn the third quarter earnings call, Inari Medical’s management confirmed that 68% of its revenues were derived from the sale of FlowTriever Systems and 32% from the sale of ClotTriever and other systems.On the same call, management also continued to make progress across the six products that are in full market release in the second half of 2023. Three of these products, REVCORE, InThrill and ProTrieve, add direct incremental revenue opportunities. Management also confirmed gaining good initial traction and is receiving excellent clinical feedback across all three products.Per management, Inari Medical witnessed another quarter of record case and revenue production outside of the United States. Its performance was driven primarily by increased adoption in Western Europe, complemented by solid case growth in its early-stage markets in Latin America, Canada and Asia-Pacific. The company continues to make good progress in both China and Japan and anticipates beginning to treat patients in both these markets in 2024. Management expects its international business could represent greater than 20% of total revenues over time on the back of unmet needs.During the reported quarter, NARI launched two new products — RevCore and T16 Curve catheter — both targeting patients with venous thromboembolism.Inari Medical, Inc.

The company continued to make impressive progress with respect to its product portfolio, which saw robust product adoption. Geographical performances were also impressive.

The uptick in locum tenens revenues and Language interpretation services revenues was impressive. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the stock.Management confirmed that its definitive agreement to acquire MSDR will likely bolster AMN Healthcare’s presence in the robust locum tenens market. On the earnings call, management confirmed that the company had strengthened its ability to deliver multifaceted tech-enabled workforce solutions to simplify labor management and provide a variety of options for making the labor force more flexible and cost effective. Additionally, management believes that clients would be able to access AMN Healthcare’s full set of solutions via our better-integrated sales and service organization. These look promising for the stock.However, AMN Healthcare’s dismal top-line and bottom-line performances were disappointing. The decline in all the segmental revenues during the reported quarter was worrying. The contraction of the adjusted operating margin raises our apprehension about the stock. AMN Healthcare expects to register a decline in its overall top line and all its segments in the fourth quarter of 2023, which is concerning.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAMN Healthcare currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Abbott Laboratories ABT, DexCom, Inc.

Stryker’s prospects in 2023 seem promising on the back of strong customer demand for its existing products as well as new launches.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this maker of infant formula, medical devices and drugs have returned -0.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.8% change. The Zacks Medical - Products industry, to which Abbott belongs, has lost 3.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Abbott is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.44 points to a change of -16.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.62 indicates a change of +3.9% from what Abbott is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Abbott.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Abbott, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.14 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $40.01 billion and $41.55 billion estimates indicate -8.4% and +3.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAbbott reported revenues of $10.14 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.6%. EPS of $1.14 for the same period compares with $1.15 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.6%. The EPS surprise was +3.64%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Abbott is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Abbott. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil company have returned -9.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.8% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, to which Chevron belongs, has lost 3.6% over this period.

This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.10 indicates a change of +10.3% from what Chevron is expected to report a year ago.

After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Chevron, the consensus sales estimate of $55.89 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1%. The $209.54 billion and $223 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -14.9% and +6.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryChevron reported revenues of $54.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18.9%. EPS of $3.05 for the same period compares with $5.56 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.15%. The EPS surprise was -17.12%.Over the last four quarters, Chevron surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient.

The $37.42 billion and $44.09 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.4% and +17.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUber reported revenues of $9.23 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.3%. EPS of $0.18 for the same period compares with -$1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.97%. The EPS surprise was +1900%.Over the last four quarters, Uber surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Uber is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Uber. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Many people living with diabetes aren\'t aware of this incredible life-changing technology and Abbott\'s efforts to make it accessible. The goal of \'Countdown at a Crossroads\' is to change that - and I am energized to help by fostering awareness.""The World is at a Diabetes CrossroadsThere are more than half a billion adults across the world living with diabetes and this number is only predicted to rise1. Yet only 1% of them are using technology like FreeStyle Libre, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system3, signifying that they are not aware of or do not have access to this technology.Story continuesCGM technology provides real-time data to help a person see how food, activity and medicine can have an impact on their glucose levels, with the additional benefit of improving their health by reducing their hemoglobin A1C4. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lowering your A1C can lower a person\'s risk of complications from diabetes such as nerve damage, eye problems and heart disease.More people are using medications like GLP-1s to improve their glycemic control or help with weight loss. In a newly published analysis from Abbott, data has shown that these drugs can work better with CGMs by not only providing weight loss but also helping people living with diabetes create positive, long-term behavior changes to assist in managing their condition.Making Critical Diabetes Technology More AccessibleAbbott has taken steps at every stage of the design process to make FreeStyle Libre systems the most cost-efficient. Priced at 70% less than other CGM systems, FreeStyle Libre is the most affordable5 option for the one in 10 Americans6 who are living with diabetes.""We purposefully made FreeStyle Libre technology to be accessible and affordable,"" said Jared Watkin, senior vice president of Abbott\'s diabetes care business. ""However, even with our millions of users, we know that continuous glucose monitors are still not being used by the vast majority of people who can benefit from them. We\'re working hard to spread awareness and improve access, and we hope that our critical innovation can play a part in slowing the diabetes epidemic.""CGMs have become the standard of care for people with Type 1 diabetes, yet up to 95% of people living with diabetes in America have Type 2 diabetes7, where approximately less than 10% of people use CGM technology8 - either because they are not aware or do not have insurance coverage. In several studies, CGMs have been proven to help people living with Type 2 diabetes significantly reduce diabetes-related hospitalizations while also enabling them to control their diabetes without adding insulin therapy to their treatment routine9.Abbott will continue to work with health systems, payors and government agencies in the U.S. and around the world to expand reimbursement for CGMs so that all people living with diabetes can get access.Countdown at a CrossroadsMirroring the staggering reality that a new person is diagnosed with diabetes every 23 seconds in the United States6, the Crossroads structure on display at the Oculus Center in New York City on Nov. 1 will generate a different face of someone impacted by diabetes every 23 seconds. Additionally, visitors can scan a QR code featured on the installation or visit www.Crossroads.Abbott to learn more about diabetes, the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring technology, and read personal stories of patients positively impacted by FreeStyle Libre\'s transformative technology.With a mere 1% of those globally living with diabetes utilizing CGMs to manage their condition3, Abbott is recognizing the other 99% who could benefit from this vital tool. For every person who visits www.Crossroads.Abbott during November\'s National Diabetes Awareness Month, a $0.99 donation* will be provided to the American Diabetes Association\'s Health Equity Now program.""Our ongoing partnership with Abbott underscores the importance of making diabetes care and management accessible,"" said Charles ""Chuck"" Henderson, chief executive officer of the American Diabetes Association.

It takes all of us working together to end diabetes.""To learn more about \'Countdown at a Crossroads,\' visit www.Crossroads.Abbott and follow Abbott on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.The FreeStyle Libre portfolio is the number one sensor-based glucose monitoring system in the world10 changing the lives of more than 5 million people across more than 60 countries8 by providing breakthrough technology that is accessible and affordable5.About AbbottAbbott is a global healthcare leader that helps people live more fully at all stages of life.

AVNS reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of 30 cents, up 25% year over year. The bottom line topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.GAAP loss per share from continuing operations in the quarter under review was 19 cents against the year-ago period’s EPS of 23 cents.RevenuesRevenues grossed $171.3 million in the reported quarter, down 0.6% year over year. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8%.Per management, the top line was hampered by lower hyaluronic acid portfolio (HA) sales. Lower revenues from the Pain Management and Recovery portfolio also weighed on the top line. However, this was offset by a higher volume in the Digestive Health portfolio and slightly favorable pricing and foreign currency translation effects.Excluding currency and the impact of products no longer sold, organic growth was flat.Segmental AnalysisAvanos provides a portfolio of innovative product offerings that focus on Pain Management and Recovery and Digestive Health.Pain Management and Recovery’s net revenues of $76.3 million decreased 11.7% year over year on a reported basis. At constant exchange rate (CER), revenues were down 10%. Although the segment benefited from Diros revenues, the negative impact of foreign exchange and Avanos’ previously-announced decision to discontinue certain low-growth, low-margin products dragged the revenues. Management also confirmed witnessing continued softness across the Game Ready and HA product categories during the reported quarter. This figure compares to our third-quarter projection of $69.7 million.Digestive Health’s net revenues of $95 million improved 10.6% year over year. At CER, revenues were up nearly 10.5%. The business saw continued strong execution for NeoMed. Avanos also recorded continued expansion of its U.S. CORTRAK standard of care offering. This figure compares to our third-quarter projection of $86 million.Story continuesAvanos Medical, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAvanos Medical, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAvanos Medical, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Avanos Medical, Inc. QuoteMargin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, Avanos’ gross profit fell 4.7% to $95.5 million. The gross margin contracted 240 basis points (bps) to 55.8%.Selling and general expenses rose 0.5% to $78.7 million. Research and development expenses decreased 14.1% year over year to $6.1 million. Adjusted operating expenses of $84.8 million decreased 0.7% year over year.Adjusted operating profit totaled $10.7 million, reflecting a 27.7% decline from the prior-year quarter’s level. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter contracted 234 bps to 6.2%.Financial UpdateThe company exited third-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents worth $107.1 million compared with $81.8 million at the end of second quarter. Total debt at the third-quarter end was $264.5 million compared with $209.5 million at the second-quarter end.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of third-quarter 2023 totaled $19.7 million compared with $57.2 million in the prior-year period.GuidanceAvanos has reiterated its 2023 continuing operations guidance.The company continues to estimate its revenues for the full year in the range of $675 million-$685 million.Avanos continues to anticipate 2023 adjusted EPS between $1.05 and $1.15. The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $1.14.Our TakeAvanos’ ended the third quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. Its continued strength in the Digestive Health segment in the quarter was encouraging. The robust growth in NeoMed and CORTRAK was promising. On the earnings call, management confirmed that the early performance of Avanos’ newly acquired Trident product line has been solid. Management is also upbeat about the U.S. market launch, which commenced recently. This raises our optimism about the stock.Management also confirmed during the earnings call that it anticipates a continued reduction in supply-chain disruptions and strong demand for Avanos’ products. This also looks promising for the stock.Yet, Avanos’ year-over-year decline in the top line and lower revenues from the Pain Management and Recovery segment were disappointing. Management also confirmed during the earnings call that its efforts to reduce inventory negatively impacted fixed cost absorption. The company’s third-quarter performance was also hampered by the ongoing inflationary pressure on electronic components. These raise our apprehension. The contraction of both margins does not bode well.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAvanos currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Abbott Laboratories ABT, DexCom, Inc. DXCM and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.Abbott, carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy), reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted EPS of $1.14, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $4.90.Our TakeQuidelOrtho ended the third quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. An uptick in the company’s Non-Respiratory revenues was impressive. The company registered robust revenues from its Labs and TM segments and China and Other regions, which were encouraging. QuidelOrtho also recorded strong revenue growth in the EMEA region on a reported basis, which buoys optimism.The company also recorded solid revenues from its Instrument and Recurring revenue categories, which were promising. The continued uptick in Sofia instruments and growth in QuidelOrtho’s integrated installed base and automation were encouraging.In September, QuidelOrtho received a CLIA Waiver from the FDA, which applies to its new Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA (fluorescent immunoassay). The test, intended for prescription use only, can be used in CLIA-waived point-of-care settings. This looked promising for the stock.However, dismal top-line and bottom-line results were disappointing. Lower Respiratory revenues during the quarter were also not promising. The decline in its POC and MDx segments and geographically in North America was discouraging. The decline in QuickVue revenues was also worrying. The contraction of both margins also does not bode well.Zacks Rank and Key PicksQuidelOrtho currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Abbott Laboratories ABT, DexCom, Inc.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is OP Bancorp (OPBK). OPBK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.83. This compares to its industry\'s average Forward P/E of 10.35. OPBK\'s Forward P/E has been as high as 7.19 and as low as 4.98, with a median of 6.22, all within the past year.Another notable valuation metric for OPBK is its P/B ratio of 0.70. The P/B ratio pits a stock\'s market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock\'s P/B looks solid versus its industry\'s average P/B of 1.52. Over the past 12 months, OPBK\'s P/B has been as high as 1.07 and as low as 0.62, with a median of 0.78.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock\'s price with the company\'s revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. OPBK has a P/S ratio of 0.98. This compares to its industry\'s average P/S of 1.55.Story continuesFinally, our model also underscores that OPBK has a P/CF ratio of 4.24. This metric focuses on a firm\'s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. OPBK\'s current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry\'s average P/CF of 12.23. Within the past 12 months, OPBK\'s P/CF has been as high as 5.53 and as low as 3.27, with a median of 4.28.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that OP Bancorp is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, OPBK sticks out at as one of the market\'s strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ANF recently overtook the 20-day moving average, and this suggests a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a well-liked trading tool because it provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. Additionally, short-term traders find this SMA very beneficial, as it smooths out short-term price trends and shows more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.Similar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend.ANF has rallied 9.6% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. This combination suggests ANF could be on the verge of another move higher.The bullish case solidifies once investors consider ANF's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 2 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.Investors may want to watch ANF for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Whether it be missed opportunities or selling quality stocks too soon, we’ve all been embarrassed at least a time or two.There’s no shame in the occasional failure as it’s how we learn. Particularly in an environment such as the stock market, it’s simply impossible to be right all of the time. Even professionals get it wrong a fair chunk; it’s the nature of the beast. Famously dubbed the “Great Humiliator”, the stock market attempts to fool the masses as often as possible.This recent downturn certainly has investors spooked, with the major U.S. indexes undercutting key support and technical levels. Markets remain in the midst of a multi-month correction; selling pressure accelerated last week, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 making new closing lows for the move. The Dow also fell back into negative territory on the year. Any rallies over the past few months have been short-lived and met by swift selling pressure.Still, a host of sectors are extremely oversold and ripe for a turnaround. And when we factor in that third-quarter earnings have come in above expectations, a potential setup for a year-end rally is in play.Q3 Earnings Surprise to the UpsideDespite the recent volatility, the Q3 earnings season results have been better than expected. Including the companies that reported through the end of last week, we now have results from 246 S&P 500 members (or 49.2% of the total membership). Earnings for these companies are up 6% from the same period last year on 2.1% higher revenues.More than 1,100 companies are set to report this week, including 159 S&P 500 members. Expectations for the third quarter have evolved in a bullish manner, with earnings now projected to grow 1.2% from the year-ago period on 1.2% higher revenues. This would mark the first quarter that earnings growth has turned positive after contracting during the last three consecutive quarters, potentially putting an end to the corporate earnings recession.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe major indices are clearly oversold and a snap-back rally could happen at any time. Markets have also entered a positive seasonal period with bullish historical statistics on their side. Dating back to 1950, the average year for the S&P 500 tends to see a seasonal (Fall) pullback bottom out on October 27th.In terms of tech strength, dating back to 1971 the Nasdaq has rallied in Q4 from its October low into year-end in 46 of 52 years (88.5%), with an average gain of 9.5%. Of the six losses, only one year (2007) was a pre-election year. Those are pretty favorable odds to say the least.If stocks are in for a fourth-quarter surge, where should we look?Key Stocks to WatchNot many stocks have held up well through the recent correction. Even fewer have hit new 52-week highs in October, but that’s exactly what we have in two well-known retail names.Both companies are part of the Zacks Retail – Apparel and Shoes industry group, which currently ranks in the top 33% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because this group is ranked in the top half of all industries, we expect it to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. Also note the favorable valuation metrics for this industry group below:ShutterstockImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHistorical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.American Eagle Outfitters AEO stock has begun to show signs of outperformance in the second half of the year. The company has benefitted from a boost in its Aerie and American Eagle brands, driven by solid demand and profit improvement initiatives. A Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, AEO has rallied more than 27% this year:StockChartsImage Source: StockChartsThe established retailer has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 43.15%. Analysts covering AEO have increased third-quarter earnings estimates by 17.95% in the past 60 days. The Q3 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $0.46/share, a 9.52% upgrade versus the same quarter last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnother leading stock in Abercrombie & Fitch ANF, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has exploded higher this year on continued momentum in the Abercrombie brand along with sequential improvement in the Hollister brand. ANF shares have surged nearly 157% this year:StockChartsImage Source: StockChartsThe modern-day fashion retailer has exceeded earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 725%. Analysts covering ANF are in agreement and have been raising earnings estimates across the board. For the third quarter, estimates have been raised by 10.31% in the past 60 days. The Q3 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $1.07/share, a whopping 10,600% improvement versus the same quarter last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat the Zacks Model RevealsThe Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) seeks to find companies that have recently witnessed positive earnings estimate revision activity. This more recent information can be a better predictor for future earnings and can give investors a leg up during earnings season. The technique has proven to be quite useful for finding positive earnings surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better with a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time according to our 10-year backtest.ANF is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and boasts a +1.87% Earnings ESP. Another beat may be in the cards when the company reports Q3 results on November 21st. ANF is ranked favorably by our Zacks Style Scores, with best-possible marks in our Value, Growth and Momentum categories.We’re now in the thick of the third-quarter earnings season. Remember, the stocks that hold up best through pullbacks and corrections typically lead the next leg up. Make sure you’re taking advantage of all that Zacks has to offer to uncover leading stocks like AEO and ANF.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Dutch Bros (BROS) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.08 a share, just four days from its upcoming earnings release on November 7, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.08 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.07 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Dutch Bros has an Earnings ESP of 12.18%.BROS is one of just a large database of Consumer Staples stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Monster Beverage (MNST).Monster Beverage, which is readying to report earnings on February 27, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.40 a share, and MNST is 116 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Monster Beverage is $0.40, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.85%.Story continuesBROS and MNST's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Santiago/Getty ImagesIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowANFWatchlistDozens of men have filed a class action lawsuit alleging Abercrombie & Fitch was complicit in a decade-long sex trafficking scheme carried out by the fashion company’s former CEO.According to the complaint filed Friday in federal court in New York, Michael Jeffries, who ran the company between 1992 and 2014, “used his role as CEO of Abercrombie to prey upon attractive young men who believed that Jeffries was going to hire them as an Abercrombie model.”Abercrombie & Fitch told CNN it does not comment on pending litigation.The complaint alleges Jeffries ran an expansive sex-trafficking operation, coercing and forcing young men to engage in sexual acts in exchange for money and promises of employment.The lawsuit states that, in a series of instances, one aspiring model was invited to multiple Abercrombie & Fitch casting events in New York, France and London, and was sexually assaulted at least seven times at these events. The model was allegedly led to believe that this process “was essential to become an Abercrombie model.”The total number of victims is believed to exceed 100, the lawsuit states, and “we anticipate more men coming forward in light of (the) filing,” said attorney Brittany Henderson, a partner of the firm representing some of the plaintiffs.“Sexual exploitation does not discriminate based on gender,” Henderson told CNN in a statement. “Men have been exploited in the modeling and fashion industries for decades. The #MeToo movement ignited a fire in our country that empowered survivors to come forward and be heard. This case is paramount to expanding the #MeToo movement across genders into the #WeToo movement, and eradicating sexual exploitation in the entire industry, starting with Abercrombie & Fitch.”The plaintiffs are seeking a trial by jury, as well as punitive and compensatory damages.“Mr. Jeffries will not comment in the press on this new lawsuit, as he has likewise chosen not to regarding litigation in the past. The courtroom is where we will deal with this matter,” Jeffries’ attorney Brian Bieber told CNN.Story continuesThe complaint also names Jeffries’ long-time partner Matthew Smith as a defendant claiming that he sexually assaulted men alongside Jeffries. While Smith did not hold any official position at the company, he was still given access to non-public information such as sales reports and financial documents, according to the complaint, and allowed to hold “managerial authority.”Bieber said that Smith does not yet have legal representation. CNN has not been able to determine whether he has retained a lawyer.The 21-count lawsuit brings nine counts against Abercrombie & Fitch, alleging that the company was aware of Jeffries’ and Smith’s abuse and knowingly turned a blind eye to the “unfettered” amount of money that Jefferies withdrew from corporate-affiliated accounts in order to pay off victims.“To put it plainly, Jeffries needed a corporation that knew he was engaging in illegal activity and did not care, which Jeffries had in Abercrombie,” the complaint states, adding that this negligence makes Abercrombie & Fitch liable for the physical injury and emotional distress experienced by the plaintiffs as a result of the alleged assault committed by Jeffries and Smith.“Abercrombie financially benefited in that as a by-product of the sex-trafficking venture, (the company) was able to employ male models to further promote their brand image, while simultaneously keeping Jeffries happy and productive, allowing him to rebrand the company’s image and transform it into a billion-dollar industry leader,” the lawsuit states.The lawsuit comes less than a month after the BBC published allegations of eight men who said Jeffries and his partner Smith exploited them for sex. The men alleged they were recruited through a middleman who used a network of recruiters, and paid them $500 to $1,000 for every referral, according to the BBC report, which was the culmination of a two-year investigation.Days after the BBC report, Abercrombie & Fitch said it had launched its own investigation into the allegations.“The company’s current executive leadership team and board of directors were not aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Jeffries,” the retailer told CNN in a statement earlier this month. “For close to a decade, a new executive leadership team and refreshed board of directors have successfully transformed our brands and culture into the values-driven organization we are today. We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind.”CNN’s Parija Kavilanz contributed to this reportFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com', 'ANFANNE D\'INNOCENZIOOctober 27, 2023 at 11:27 AM·2 min readFILE - In this May 22, 2017, file photo, a store window reflects a street scene at an Abercrombie & Fitch store on New York\'s Fifth Avenue.

But he faced criticism for the company\'s sexualized marketing, including billboards and beefy models that alienated potential customers who didn\'t fit into its image.The lawsuit comes after a BBC report earlier this month that raised similar allegations against Jeffries and his partner Matthew Smith.The lawsuit, filed by David Bradberry in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges Jeffries had modeling scouts scouring the internet and elsewhere to identify attractive young men seeking to be the next face of Abercrombie. Often these prospective models became sex-trafficking victims, sent to New York and abroad and abused by Jeffries and other men, all under the guise that they were being recruited to become the next Abercrombie model, the lawsuit contends.“Jeffries was so important to the profitability of the brand that he was given complete autonomy to perform his role as CEO however he saw fit, including through the use of blatant international sex-trafficking and abuse of prospective Abercrombie models,” the suit alleges.The lawsuit names Jeffries, Smith, and the Jeffries Family Office LLC. It seeks class-action status and estimates that over a hundred young models, in addition to Bradberry, were victims.A&F, based in New Albany, Ohio, declined to comment Friday. Earlier this month, the retailer said that it had hired an outside law firm to conduct an independent investigation into the issues raised by the BBC. It said the company’s current leaders and board of directors were not aware of the allegations of Jeffries\' sexual misconduct.Story continues“For close to a decade, a new executive leadership team and refreshed board of directors have successfully transformed our brands and culture into the values-driven organization we are today,"" the company said. “We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind.”Jeffries\' attorney, Brian Bieber, a shareholder with the Miami law firm of GrayRobinson, said in a statement that Jeffries “will not comment in the press on this new lawsuit, as he has likewise chosen not to regarding litigation in the past. ”“The courtroom is where we will deal with this matter,"" Bieber added.The Jeffries Family Office didn\'t respond immediately for requests for comment.______Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio', 'ANFDaniel Wiessner and Katherine MastersOctober 27, 2023 at 11:25 AM·2 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowANFWatchlistBy Daniel Wiessner and Katherine MastersOct 27 (Reuters) - A group of once-aspiring Abercrombie & Fitch models on Friday sued the retailer and its former chief executive officer, Michael Jeffries, alleging the company had benefited from a sex trafficking operation led by Jeffries.Former model David Bradberry in the proposed class action filed in Manhattan federal court claims Jeffries, who was CEO from 1992 to 2014, forced models to take drugs and engage in sexual acts with him and others for the chance to be featured in Abercrombie\'s provocative catalogs.According to the lawsuit, Jeffries used his position as the CEO of Abercrombie to recruit men and invite them to castings at his homes in New York City, the Hamptons, and other locations. Bradberry and other men say they were forced to take drugs and participate in sexual acts with Jeffries, his business partner Matthew Smith, and others connected to Abercrombie.The lawsuit names Abercrombie, Jeffries, Smith and Jeffries\' Ohio-based company Jeffries Family Office as defendants. An Abercrombie spokesperson said the company does not comment on pending litigation. Jeffries, Smith and Jeffries Family Office could not immediately be reached for comment.According to the lawsuit, Abercrombie company officers knew about the conduct and the company paid settlements to people who accused Jeffries of sexual abuse or harassment. The lawsuit alleges Abercrombie facilitated the ""sex-trafficking conspiracy"" as Jeffries continued to reap massive profits.Jeffries is often credited with spearheading the company’s transformation into a successful teen retailer known for its cologne-filled stores and ads featuring semi-nude models.He resigned in 2014 amid criticism that he had failed to keep pace with the tastes of teen shoppers, and received a payout of more than $25 million.Since he stepped down, the company has moved away from its suggestive advertising and rebranded as a more inclusive retailer with expanded sizing and clothing geared toward young adult shoppers.Story continuesThe BBC earlier this month first reported allegations by Bradberry and others that Jeffries had abused models.Abercrombie told the BBC that the company was ""appalled and disgusted"" by the allegations and does not tolerate abuse or harassment. According to the report, an unidentified lawyer for Jeffries said the ex-CEO would not comment on his personal life.Bradberry accused Abercrombie and Jeffries of violating a federal law prohibiting sex trafficking, among other claims. Models were told that engaging in sexual acts was a typical part of the Abercrombie casting process and were paid thousands of dollars after performing sexual acts against their will, according to the lawsuit. They traveled to New York, London, Morocco and France to meet with Jeffries.Bradberry is seeking unspecified damages on behalf of a class of more than 100 men who were allegedly abused.

Data and AI are the highest priority tech investments, with 79% of CHROs planning to invest in these areas next year, a 10% jump from this year.HR leaders are generally optimistic about AI. The majority of respondents say the technology will enhance productivity by automating routine tasks, enable increased focus on creative and innovative tasks, and improve job satisfaction by, again, reducing time spent on mundane tasks. About half say it will allow employees to engage in more meaningful work.All surveyed CHROs report already implementing some form of generative AI training in their organization. Seventy-four percent say they provide training on effectively using generative AI, and 56% plan to offer academic partnerships that provide AI skills training next year.Accenture is one of them. The professional services firm recently announced\xa0a three-year,\xa0$3 billion investment in AI that will double its AI talent to 80,000. For Allison Horn, Accenture’s global head of talent, the company's survey results provide a sigh of relief that her peers are also investing in the novel technology.“It's reassuring. This is game-changing in a really good, positive, energy-producing way,” she says. “Generative AI is really going to get rid of some of the mundane work and get us to the parts of work that we all enjoy more.”Interestingly, though, the top AI investment priority for HR leaders isn't in their function. Rather, it's in customer service (56%), followed by HR (45%), and finance (44%). That differs from CEOs' AI investment priorities. Of the 429 CEOs polled, the top use cases for generative AI are in the supply chain, manufacturing, and customer service, while HR is the lowest priority.Story continuesIt may surprise some that HR isn’t a top focus for chief executives or even their people ops leaders, but both functions agree that customer service is an area that will see quicker ROI in improving job quality.“When you see something like what generative AI can produce for things like customer service and call centers, it's an obvious value case,” says Horn. “And it's also one that usually has scale...If you're talking about something like call centers, [that’s] hundreds or thousands of people. So you can start to see this value very quickly.”Paige McGlauflinpaige.mcglauflin@fortune.com@paidionThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com""]"
ADBE,"[""ADBEeditorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)November 3, 2023 at 7:00 AM·3 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowADBEWatchlistOver the past year, many Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Adobe Adobe Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman & CEO, Shantanu Narayen, for US$17m worth of shares, at about US$481 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$559, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 8.0% of Shantanu Narayen's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in Adobe than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Adobe insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$415m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Adobe Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Adobe shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Adobe insiders selling. Of course, the future is what matters most.

Adobe picks up licensing fees from customers, which form the bulk of its revenue.ADBE was added to the Zacks Focus List on March 13, 2020 at $285 per share. Since then, shares have increased 96.04% to $558.71.14 analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2023, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.58 to $15.93. ADBE also boasts an average earnings surprise of 3.3%.Additionally, Adobe Systems' earnings are expected to grow 16.2% for the current fiscal year.Since stock prices respond to earnings estimate revisions, it can be very profitable to buy stocks with an increased earnings outlook.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +8.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Adobe falls in, has gained 6.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Adobe is expected to post earnings of $4.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $15.93 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +16.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.86 indicates a change of +12.1% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Adobe is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Adobe, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.01 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.37 billion and $21.61 billion estimates indicate +10% and +11.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAdobe reported revenues of $4.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.3%. EPS of $4.09 for the same period compares with $3.40 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.85 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.72%. The EPS surprise was +3.02%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Adobe is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Adobe. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see some more stocks on the list, go directly to 5 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts.US stocks recovered on Monday after suffering losses amid geopolitical headwinds and concerns around rising inflation and rate hikes. Other market movements included a drop in Brent crude oil prices and a slip in gold prices. These shifts indicated a reduced demand for safe-haven assets as risk appetite among investors increased. Meanwhile, the ten-year Treasury yields saw a modest increase, reaching 4.85%. Treasury market is bracing for an upcoming SEC rule, aiming to regulate hedge fund bets and enhance financial stability. The rule, proposed last September, could shift more trading in the $25 trillion Treasuries market to central clearing, impacting industry dynamics. Market participants anticipate the rule's finalization within weeks, potentially by mid-November, but key details remain uncertain, reported Reuters. Concerns include the implementation timeline and whether the industry will transition to central clearing all at once or in phases. The rule's impact on industry players, including banks and hedge funds, is unclear, raising questions about costs and potential disruptions. Experts emphasize the need for careful implementation to avoid unintended consequences. The SEC rule is a significant response to the review launched after the near market collapse in March 2020. Treasury market reform is widely supported, but the specifics of the SEC rule's impact remain uncertain. The industry expects the final rule next month, prompting preparations for potential changes.The financial landscape in the Asia-Pacific region is poised for a distinctive trajectory as central banks in the area are anticipated to embark on a series of interest rate hikes over the next six months. This stands in contrast to prevailing trends in other regions where either a status quo in interest rates is expected or substantial cuts are anticipated. The driving forces behind this regional divergence include the resilience of the U.S. dollar and the upward trajectory of oil prices. Countries spanning from Australia to Indonesia and South Korea are set to uphold a tightening monetary policy stance. Traders are expressing this sentiment through an average estimation of a 13 basis points increase in interest rates for the Asia-Pacific region, excluding China. This projection is derived from market implied policy rates, underlining the expectations for a gradual tightening of monetary conditions. In contrast, developed markets outside of Asia are expected to maintain their existing interest rate levels. However, in regions such as Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, substantial cuts in interest rates are anticipated.Story continuesMeanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., tech stocks such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Snap Inc.

As of the latest market data, EastGroup Properties, Inc. (NYSE:EGP) stock is currently valued at $157.51, reflecting a slight decrease of 0.5%. The adjustment in market value following the upgrade implies a nuanced response from investors to the improved rating and the heightened price target set by Raymond James.Here is what Baron Real Estate Income Fund has to say about EastGroup Properties, Inc. (NYSE:EGP) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Though we expect rent growth to moderate from its frenzied pace of the last few years, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for industrial REITs. With industrial vacancies at less than 4%, new supply expected to moderate in 2024, rents on in-place leases more than 50% below market, and multi-faceted demand drivers including the ongoing growth in e-commerce and companies seeking to improve inventory supply-chain resiliency by carrying more inventory (shift from just in time to just in case inventory), we believe our investments in industrial warehouse REITs like EastGroup Properties, Inc. have compelling multi-year cash-flow growth runways.”\xa0Click here to continue reading and check out 5 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts.\xa0Suggested articles:Bill Gates’ Investment Company’s 10 Newest Stock PicksTop 30 Oncology Companies in the WorldBest Dividend Aristocrats According to AnalystsDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey."", 'nheimer Isn’t Ready to Abandon Its S&P 500 4,900 Target Just Yet — Here Are 2 Stocks That Could Lead the Way        HOME    MAIL    NEWS    FINANCE    SPORTS    ENTERTAINMENT    LIFE    SEARCH    SHOPPING    YAHOO PLUS    MORE...

Last year saw steep losses, this year started with a strong rally, and the last few months have seen a correction. The big question now is whether the recent market turbulence is a temporary blip or the beginning of a more significant downturn.John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist from Oppenheimer, has set out the bullish case, as befits a man who’s predicting the S&P 500 will hit 4,900 by year’s end – or a gain of 18% in just the next two months.In part, Stoltzfus sees the Federal Reserve’s current policy of monetary tightening as a key supportive factor for the economy and the markets. In recent comments with CNBC, the Oppenheimer strategist said, “We were expecting that the Fed would continue to be vigilant against inflation but would remain sensitive to effects of its policy on the economy. We said it would depend on the resilience of the economy, and today’s GDP print says ‘resilience’ all over it, and the current third quarter earnings season is showing resilience…”Stoltzfus isn’t the only bull at Oppenheimer; the firm’s stock analysts are picking out the stocks that can lead the way forward. We’ve used the database at TipRanks to pull up the details on 2 of these stock picks; here they are, presented along with comments from some of Oppenheimer’s top stock analysts.Don’t missJ.P. Morgan Is Looking for the Silver Lining in the Current Market Headwinds — Here Are 2 Stocks the Banking Giant Likes Right NowTipRanks’ ‘Perfect 10’ List:\xa0These 2 Top-Rated Industrial Stocks Have What It Takes to SurgeBank of America Says Contrarian Buy Signal Could Push Stocks Higher;\xa0Here Are 2 Names the Banking Giant Likes Right NowAdobe, Inc. (ADBE)We’ll start with Adobe, the software company that leads the field in publishing and content creation tools, as well as design and editing tools. Adobe is well-known as the distributor of the Creative Cloud, the content creation package that includes Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, among others, serving as a one-stop shop for digital creation professionals.Story continuesThe company has a global footprint and more than 29,000 employees – and it brought in more than $17.6 billion in total revenue last year. The company has solid prospects going forward as it embraces emerging AI technology to enhance its product lines. Adobe’s Firefly product, a generative AI system capable of adding features across Adobe’s full product line, is designed to streamline the content creation process in all forms. From the product user’s perspective, Adobe’s addition of AI into its software offers the promise of significant improvements in efficiency and production times.In short, Adobe effectively meets the challenges of today’s digital world, as reflected in the company’s financial results. Adobe has witnessed both revenues and earnings on an upward trajectory for the past several years, and the recently reported Q3 of fiscal year 2023 continues this trend.The company’s top-line performance in the quarter, which concluded this past September 1, reached $4.89 billion, a 10% year-over-year increase and $20 million better than expected. At the bottom line, the non-GAAP EPS amounted to $4.09, surpassing estimates by 11 cents. Year-over-year EPS growth exceeded 20%, and the company generated $1.87 billion in cash from operations.Oppenheimer’s 5-star analyst, Brian Schwartz, is impressed by Adobe’s forward prospects, and writes, “We see a strengthening business momentum, a favorable outlook for FY2024, and durable growth based on positive fundamental trends and a top position in software for the generative AI opportunity gleaned from our customer and industry surveys…”The analyst, who is ranked in the top 1% off all Wall Street analysts, goes on to add, “In our view, Adobe investors will be rewarded through year-end and next fiscal year as concerns on penetration, pricing tolerance, and generative AI weakening the competitive moat dissipates. Additionally, investors will increasingly appreciate that its internal R&D and Firefly product strategy has successfully reenergized its product portfolio and places the company in a better position for durable growth from adding users and monetizing on its large install-base.”Schwartz uses these comments to back up his rating on the stock, which he upgrades from Neutral to Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his price target of $660 implies a one-year upside potential of 26%. (Watch Schwartz’s track record)Leading tech firms usually get plenty of Wall Street attention, and Adobe has 28 recent analyst reviews on file. These break down to 20 Buys, 7 Holds, and 1 Sell – for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. ADBE shares are priced at $522.84 and the average target price, $609.85, suggests a gain of ~17% lies on the horizon. (See ADBE stock forecast)Xylem, Inc. (XYL)For our second Oppenheimer pick, we’re staying within the technology sector, but this time, we’re focusing on water technology. Xylem is a leading provider of high-end water transport and treatment technology. The company claims a diverse customer base that includes residential, commercial, and agricultural water suppliers, as well as industrial firms and public utilities. Xylem has business around the world, in 150 countries, and boasts a $21 billion market cap.In May of this year, the company announced a merger with Evoqua Water Technologies, a move that created the most advanced platform for meeting water challenges in the world today. The merger was an all-stock transaction valued at $7.5 billion. The combined company continues under the Xylem name, and its product line includes pumps, valves, heat exchangers, dispensing equipment, and treatment and testing equipment, designed in-house and distributed worldwide to meet modern challenges of water scarcity, which affect at least 1.8 billion people.The last set of quarterly results, released in August for 2Q23, included results after the Evoqua merger. The company’s top line for Q2 came to $1.7 billion, up 26% y/y and some $60 million ahead of expectations. The firm’s bottom line, reported as a non-GAAP EPS of 98 cents for the six months ended on June 30, was 17 cents better than had been forecast. Xylem finished Q2 with $708 million in cash and liquid assets on hand, down from $944 million at the end of 2022. The company’s total assets were up, however, from $7.9 billion on December 31 to $16.1 billion on June 30; this reflected gains from the Evoqua acquisition.Along with the Q2 results, Xylem raised its full-year revenue guidance for 2023 by 30% to $7.2 billion. This compared favorably to the consensus estimate of $7.14 billion.This stock caught the attention of Bryan Blair, another of Oppenheimer’s 5-star analysts. Blair is upbeat on Xylem’s post-merger expansion and prospects, and writes, “We rate XYL shares Outperform given confidence in New Xylem’s structurally improved portfolio, continued beat & raise prospects, compelling medium term growth upside, and increasingly supportive valuation following YTD share pressure. Near-term dilution appears inevitable (albeit firmly baked into expectations) and deal execution is an understandable concern given the scale of Xylem’s richly-valued Evoqua acquisition. That said, we view other trading headwinds as largely transitory (in turn driving the current buying opportunity) and strongly believe that combined Xylem–Evoqua operations are positioned for transformational and increasingly profitable growth over the coming years.”Blair’s Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating is complemented by his $118 price target, which points toward a 33% upside on the one -year horizon. (Watch Blair’s track record)Once again, we’re looking at a stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street, this one based on 9 reviews that include 6 Buys and 3 Holds. The stock’s $88.96 selling price and $123.38 average price target together imply a potential 12-month upside of ~39%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Merck & Co., Inc. MRK, Bank of America Corp. BAC, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Union Pacific Corp. UNP.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard and Analyst Reports for Merck, BofA and AMDThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the ongoing Q3 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck & Co., Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here >>>Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the results that came out the morning of Thursday, November 2nd, we now have Q3 results from 377 S&P 500 members or 75.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +1.1% from the same period last year on +1.6% higher revenues, with 82% beating EPS estimates and 61.8% beating revenue estimates.This is better earnings growth for these 377 index members relative to what we have seen from this group in the last four quarters. The EPS beats percentage at 82% is the highest for this group of 377 index members since 2021 Q2 and above the average for the preceding 20 quarters of 77.4%.The picture is different on the revenues side, with the Q3 revenue growth rate of +1.6% above the preceding period's +0.9%. but otherwise representing a decelerating growth trend.A much smaller proportion of companies have been able to beat consensus revenue estimates. In fact, the 61.8% revenue beats percentage for Q3 for these 377 index member is the lowest for this group of companies since 2020 Q1 when Covid got underway. The Q3 revenue beats percentage remains above the 20-quarter low of 58.9% but otherwise remains well below the 20-quarter average of 69.9%.Story continuesLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining the actuals for the 377 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-companies, total earnings are expected to increase +2% from the same period last year on +1.5% higher revenues.This is the first time quarterly earnings growth has turned positive after three back-to-back quarters of declines.Today's Featured Analyst Reports Merck shares have gained +7.0% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's gain of +15.2%. Company's products like Keytruda and Gardasil have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth. Merck is investing in M&A activity to strengthen its pipeline.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck's ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda's loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)Shares of Bank of America have underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (-3.7% vs. +0.8%). Because of inflationary pressure, overall costs are expected to remain elevated. The current tough macroeconomic outlook might weigh on the company's investment banking (IB) business.This, along with the volatile nature of the capital markets, might hurt non-interest income growth. Despite these headwinds, we believe that higher rates and decent loan demand will keep aiding the company's net interest income (NII) growth. The opening of financial centers and improving digital capabilities is expected to further aid the top line.(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)AMD shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the year-to-date period (+66.8% vs. +40.1%). The company's strong adoption of Ryzen and fourth-generation EPYC CPU drove Data Center and Client revenues sequentially in the third quarter. AMD expects to witness year-over-year growth in the Data Center and Client segments by double-digit percentage for the current quarter.Sequentially, Data Center segment revenues are expected to grow by a double-digit percentage. However, AMD's third-quarter 2023 results suffered from weak Gaming and Embedded revenues. Gaming declined due to lower semi-custom revenues while Embedded segment suffered from lower performance in the communications market.AMD expects weakness in the Gaming and Embedded segment to hurt revenues in the current quarter. Gaming and Embedded segment revenues are expected to decline by a double-digit percentage on a sequential basis.(You can read the full research report on AMD here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Netflix, Inc. and Union Pacific Corp.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Below are 5 reasons the worst is over for semiconductors:Historical Seasonality TrendsEquity investors often utilize historical seasonality trends as a valuable tool to gain an edge in the market. By analyzing past price movements and patterns specific to certain times of the year, investors can identify recurring trends in stock and industry performance. It\'s difficult to find a more robust and reliable historical seasonality trend than the semiconductor stocks. The PHLX Semiconductor Index was higher 80% of the time over the past twenty years for an average gain of 3.9%. Select individual names do even better in November. For example, Advanced Micro Devices has been higher 8 of the past 10 Novembers for an average gain of 15.9%. Meanwhile, industry group peer Nvidia has racked up gains of 9.1% on average over the same time.Strong Earnings Thus far this earnings season, semiconductor earnings are mixed. For example, ON Semiconductor plunged more than 20% after reporting disappointing earnings. That said, industry leaders such as AMD and Intel have produced impressive results.AI Investment Is ProliferatingEarlier this week,Arista Networks, a leading provider of cloud networking solutions, reported blockbuster earnings growth of 46% year-over-year. Arista\'s earnings prove that the AI revolution is still in the early innings because as artificial intelligence technologies continue to advance, the demand for high-performance, low-latency networking infrastructure rises. Semiconductors are another group of stocks that directly benefit from growth in AI.Story continuesEnd of Year Institutional ""Window Dressing""On Wall Street, the term window dressing refers to the practice where institutional money managers make their portfolios appear more attractive or healthier than they actually are to clients, especially before reporting periods like quarterly and annual statements are due. To dress up their portfolios, many managers will sell laggards and buy into high-performing ones just before the reporting date.By showcasing these stronger assets in their reports, fund managers aim to impress clients by creating a false impression of the fund\'s performance. In other words, the manager shows that the fund did not miss out on the year\'s big winners. With the Semiconductor Index ETF up ~40% year-to-date (and many individual names like NVDA up more), institutional investors are likely to pile into semiconductors into year-end for window dressing purposes.Bullish Technicals Though many investors have become bearish on semiconductors after the latest correction, the longer-term chart patterns show signs of life. For example, industry leader AMD is finding support at its rising 200-day moving average and is poised to break a downtrend line going back to June.Why Haven\'t You Looked at Zacks\' Top Stocks?

Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the ongoing Q3 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK), Bank of America Corporation (BAC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the results that came out the morning of Thursday, November 2nd, we now have Q3 results from 377 S&P 500 members or 75.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +1.1% from the same period last year on +1.6% higher revenues, with 82% beating EPS estimates and 61.8% beating revenue estimates. This is better earnings growth for these 377 index members relative to what we have seen from this group in the last four quarters. The EPS beats percentage at 82% is the highest for this group of 377 index members since 2021 Q2 and above the average for the preceding 20 quarters of 77.4%. The picture is different on the revenues side, with the Q3 revenue growth rate of +1.6% above the preceding period's +0.9%. but otherwise representing a decelerating growth trend. A much smaller proportion of companies have been able to beat consensus revenue estimates. In fact, the 61.8% revenue beats percentage for Q3 for these 377 index member is the lowest for this group of companies since 2020 Q1 when Covid got underway. The Q3 revenue beats percentage remains above the 20-quarter low of 58.9% but otherwise remains well below the 20-quarter average of 69.9%. Looking at Q3 as a whole, combining the actuals for the 377 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-companies, total earnings are expected to increase +2% from the same period last year on +1.5% higher revenues. Story continuesThis is the first time quarterly earnings growth has turned positive after three back-to-back quarters of declines.Today's Featured Analyst Reports\xa0 Merck share have gained +7.0% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +15.2%. Company’s products like Keytruda and Gardasil have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth. Merck is investing in M&A activity to strengthen its pipeline.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)Shares of Bank of America have underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (-3.7% vs. +0.8%). Because of inflationary pressure, overall costs are expected to remain elevated. The current tough macroeconomic outlook might weigh on the company’s investment banking (IB) business.This, along with the volatile nature of the capital markets, might hurt non-interest income growth. Despite these headwinds, we believe that higher rates and decent loan demand will keep aiding the company’s net interest income (NII) growth. The opening of financial centers and improving digital capabilities is expected to further aid the top line.(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)AMD shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the year-to-date period (+66.8% vs. +40.1%). The company’s strong adoption of Ryzen and fourth-generation EPYC CPU drove Data Center and Client revenues sequentially in third quarter. AMD expects to witness year-over-year growth in the Data Center and Client segments by double-digit percentage for the current quarter.Sequentially, Data Center segment revenues are expected to grow on a double-digit percentage. However, AMD’s third-quarter 2023 results suffered from weak Gaming and Embedded revenues. Gaming declined due to lower semi-custom revenues while Embedded segment suffered from lower performance in the communications market.AMD expects weakness in the Gaming and Embedded segment to hurt revenues in the current quarter. Gaming and Embedded segment revenues are expected to decline by a double-digit percentage on a sequential basis.(You can read the full research report on AMD here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Netflix, Inc.

Revenues of $5.8 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.65% and increased 4.2% year over year. However, the guidance was unimpressive. The company expects weakness in the Gaming and Embedded segment to hurt revenues in the current quarter.Data Center revenues declined 0.7% year over year to $1.6 billion and accounted for 27.6% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues increased 21%, driven by strong adoption of fourth-generation AMD EPYC CPUs. Our model estimate for third-quarter Data Center revenues was pegged at $1.62 billion.The Client segment revenues increased 42.2% year over year to $1.46 billion and accounted for 25.1% of total revenues.

Our model estimate for third-quarter Client revenues was pegged at $1.24 billion.The Gaming segment revenues decreased 7.7% year over year to $1.51 billion and accounted for 26% of total revenues. The decline was primarily attributed to lower semi-custom revenues.

The Gaming segment is expected to decline due to the matured console cycle. Softness in the embedded market will likely hurt Embedded revenues.Story continuesSequentially, Data Center segment revenues are expected to grow on a double-digit percentage, while Client is expected to increase.

A copy of the same can be\xa0downloaded here. In the third quarter, the strategy returned -4.6% net of fees bringing YTD returns to -8.73% net. The long book declined by 6.92% while the short book rose by 2.7%.

Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a diversified power generation and utility company. On November 2, 2023, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) stock closed at $15.50 per share. One-month return of The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) was 22.92%, and its shares lost 40.82% of their value over the last 52 weeks. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) has a market capitalization of $10.379 billion.Massif Capital made the following comment about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:""Given interest rates’ elevated state, it is perhaps unsurprising that our utility exposure has fared poorly for us this year. We should have hedged the exposure sooner with a Utility ETF short, but we did not do that until the third quarter, after much of the damage was already done. As noted above, our Utility exposure is second only to our materials exposure in terms of negative impact on the portfolio across both the third quarter and the YTD periods. This is primarily driven by our investment in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), which was down roughly 26% in the third quarter and 47% YTD. Our other utility exposure is up for the year, including our short position, which, as noted, was put on in the third quarter, and it is probably something we should have had on the books for the entire year.We attribute, for right or wrong, the entirety of the sell-off in AES to the interest rate environment. Chart overlays are always tricky, so one should not read too much into them, but as a quick sense check of the claim, if one inverts the move-in rates for a generic 10-year US government bond and overlay it with AES stock price YTD, you get the following:..""

(PRNewsfoto/The AES Corporation)""We had a strong third quarter across the board and are on track to deliver on all of our financial and strategic objectives,"" said Andrés Gluski, AES President and Chief Executive Officer.\xa0 ""We fully expect to complete construction of 3.5 GW of new renewables this year, which is more than double compared to last year.\xa0 Demand for renewables with long-term contracts remains exceptionally strong across the sector, and particularly from our primary customers, large technology companies and data centers.\xa0 As a result of this demand, we have signed a total of 3.7 GW of contracts for new renewables so far this year and expect to sign at least 5 GW before the end of the year.""Story continues""We expect to be in the top half of our Adjusted EPS4\xa0guidance range for 2023 and we are reaffirming all of our short- and long-term financial guidance metrics.\xa0 Our hedging programs and low-risk commercial structure ensure that we continue to have limited exposure to interest rates,"" said Stephen Coughlin, AES Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\xa0 ""We have already secured our asset sale proceeds target and external financing needs for the year, further strengthening our balance sheet.\xa0 Additionally, we are accelerating and increasing our asset sale program to eliminate any need for new equity until at least 2026.""Q3 2023 Financial ResultsThird quarter 2023 Net Income was $291 million, a decrease of $155 million compared to third quarter 2022.\xa0 This decrease is the result of lower contributions from LNG transactions versus 2022 at the Energy Infrastructure Strategic Business Unit (SBU), partially offset by favorable contributions at the Utilities, Renewables, and New Energy Technologies SBUs.Third quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA5\xa0(a non-GAAP financial measure) was $990 million, an increase of $59 million compared to third quarter 2022, primarily driven by higher contributions at the Utilities SBU, favorable weather conditions and new businesses at the Renewables SBU, higher revenues under a PPA termination agreement at the Energy Infrastructure SBU, and improved margins at Fluence at the New Energy Technologies SBU.\xa0 These positive drivers were partially offset by favorable LNG transactions in 2022 at the Energy Infrastructure SBU.During the third quarter of 2023, the Company realized Tax Attributes6\xa0of $18 million, a decrease of $42 million compared to third quarter 2022.Third quarter 2023 Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations (Diluted EPS) was $0.32, a decrease of $0.27 compared to third quarter 2022, primarily reflecting higher long-lived asset impairments in 2023 and lower earnings at the Energy Infrastructure SBU mainly due to unrealized foreign currency losses and favorable LNG transactions in 2022.\xa0 These negative drivers were partially offset by higher contributions at the Utilities SBU due to the 2022 recognition of previously deferred fuel and energy purchases and favorable weather conditions and new businesses at the Renewables SBU.Third quarter 2023 Adjusted Earnings Per Share7 (Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure) was $0.60, a decrease of $0.03, compared to third quarter 2022, mainly driven by lower contributions from the Energy Infrastructure SBU, higher Parent interest, and a higher adjusted tax rate, partially offset by higher contributions at the Utilities SBU.Strategic AccomplishmentsAs of today, the Company\'s backlog, which consists of projects with signed contracts, but which are not yet operational, is 13,138 MW, including 5,761 MW under construction.In year-to-date 2023, the Company completed the construction or acquisition of 1,314 MW of wind, solar and energy storage and expects to complete a total of 3.5 GW by year-end 2023.In year-to-date 2023, the Company has signed 3,740 MW of contracts for new renewables.In September 2023, the Company agreed to minority sell-downs of its businesses in the Dominican Republic and Panama, for a total of $190 million in asset sale proceeds.Guidance and Expectations7,8The Company is reaffirming its 2023 guidance for Adjusted EBITDA8 of $2,600 to $2,900 million, and its expectation for annualized growth in Adjusted EBITDA8 of 3% to 5% through 2027, from a base of its reaffirmed 2023 guidance.\xa0 Excluding the Company\'s Energy Infrastructure SBU, annualized growth in Adjusted EBITDA8 is expected to be 17% to 20% through 2027, from a base of 2023 guidance.The Company now expects full year 2023\xa0 Adjusted EPS7 to be in the top half of the guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75.\xa0 Growth in 2023 is expected to be primarily driven by new renewables expected to come online.\xa0 This growth is expected to be partially offset by lower margins from the Company\'s LNG business, due to normalization of LNG prices and the roll-off of a gas supply contract, lower contract margins in Chile, and higher interest expense in Colombia.The Company is reaffirming its annualized growth target for Adjusted EPS7 of 7% to 9% through 2025, from a base year of 2020.\xa0 The Company is also reaffirming its annualized growth target for Adjusted EPS7 of 6% to 8% through 2027, from a base of its reaffirmed 2023 guidance of $1.65 to $1.75.The Company\'s 2023 guidance is based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of September 30, 2023.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresSee Non-GAAP Measures for definitions of Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Pre-Tax Contribution, and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as

CORPORATIONNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(Unaudited)RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED PTC AND ADJUSTED EPSEBITDA is defined as earnings before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of NCI and interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of our equity affiliates, adding back interest income recognized under service concession arrangements, and excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the Energy Infrastructure SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, adding back the pre-tax effect of Production Tax Credits (""PTCs""), Investment Tax Credits (""ITCs""), and depreciation tax expense allocated to tax equity investors.The GAAP measure most comparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes is net income. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is the most relevant measure considered in the Company\'s internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments.\xa0Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, and the variability of allocations of earnings to tax equity investors, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, each of these metrics represent the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

1,165_______________________________(1)Subsidiary distributions received by Qualified Holding Companies (""QHCs"") excluded from Schedule 1. Subsidiary Distributions should not be construed as an alternative to Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, which is determined in accordance with USGAAP.\xa0Subsidiary Distributions are important to the Parent Company because the Parent Company is a holding company that does not derive any significant direct revenues from its own activities but instead relies on its subsidiaries\' business activities and the resultant distributions tofund the debt service, investment and other cash needs of the holding company.\xa0The reconciliation of the difference between the SubsidiaryDistributions and Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities consists of cash generated from operating activities that is retained atthe subsidiaries for a variety of reasons which are both discretionary and non-discretionary in nature.\xa0These factors include, but are not limitedto, retention of cash to fund capital expenditures at the subsidiary, cash retention associated with non-recourse debt covenant restrictions andrelated debt service requirements at the subsidiaries, retention of cash related to sufficiency of local GAAP statutory retained earnings at the subsidiaries, retention of cash for working capital needs at the subsidiaries, and other similar timing differences between when the cash is generated at the subsidiaries and when it reaches the Parent Company and related holding companies.(2)Parent Company Liquidity is defined as cash available to the Parent Company, including cash at qualified holding companies (QHCs), plusavailable borrowings under our existing credit facility. AES believes that unconsolidated Parent Company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent Company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES\' indebtedness.(3)The cash held at QHCs represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US. Such subsidiaries have no contractualrestrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the Parent Company. Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and generalcosts and expenses incurred outside the US. Since the cash held by these QHCs is available to the Parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to Parent and QHCs as a useful measure of cash available to the Parent to meet its international liquidity needs.\xa0Investor Contact: Susan Harcourt 703-682-1204, susan.harcourt@aes.comMedia Contact: Amy Ackerman 703-682-6399, amy.ackerman@aes.comCisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aes-expects-full-year-2023-adjusted-eps-to-be-in-the-top-half-of-guidance-range-of-1-65-to-1-75--301976483.htmlSOURCE AES CORP.', 'AESAESCEDZacks Equity ResearchOctober 31, 2023 at 5:03 AM·3 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowOops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowOops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowAESWatchlistAESCEDThe AES Corporation AES is slated to report third-quarter 2023 results on Nov 3, before market open.It reported a negative earnings surprise of 16% in the last reported quarter. The company delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 0.29% for the last four quarters.Factors to NoteIn the third quarter, AES’ service territories witnessed a mostly average weather pattern, which, in turn, is likely to have had a moderate impact on the company’s top-line performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The AES Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe AES Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe AES Corporation price-eps-surprise | The AES Corporation QuoteHowever, a few tornados and thunderstorms, along with flooding, affected some parts of the company’s service areas, which might have led to outages for its customers. This, in turn, is likely to have had some impact on AES’ overall revenues in the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.66 billion, indicating an improvement of 0.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The tornados and thunderstorms during the third quarter might have resulted in infrastructural damage for this electricity provider, thereby increasing its quarterly operating expenses. This, along with lower contributions from LNG sales and higher interest expense from incremental debt, is expected to have hurt the company’s bottom line.Nevertheless, strong utilities’ earnings, driven by the typical second-half demand seasonality, might have contributed favorably to the company’s third-quarter earnings to some extent.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 52 cents per share, indicating a deterioration of 17.5% from the prior-year quarter’s level.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AES this time.

To skip the detailed analysis of the energy industry, go directly to the 5 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.Over the last few years, the energy industry has shown quite a lot of volatility due to several reasons, including but not limited to, a pandemic followed by tense geopolitical conditions. Fossil fuels were one of the most important commodities in the world up until 2012. After that, the installation of renewable energy electricity generation capacity has outpaced the fossil fuel plants.Over the last five years, the spending on renewable energy has also exceeded fossil fuel investments as the International Energy Agency estimates that total energy sector investments will reach around $2.8 trillion in 2023 and around $1.7 trillion of it will be spent on renewable energy.Fossil Fuels OutlookFossil fuels were the favorite stocks among investors in 2022 as Big Oil was able to rack up around $200 billion in profits last year and paid around $110 billion to investors in the form of dividends and share buybacks. However, the current year did not look favorably toward the oil and gas sector. In Q2, companies such as Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) reported 56% and 49% declines in profits, respectively.The third quarter was promising for global crude oil prices due to the production cuts by OPEC countries and hit record per barrel prices for the year. The price of Brent Crude oil averaged slightly above $80 in July, $86 in August, and $94 per barrel in September. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) was one of the companies that benefited the most from the surge in oil prices and is also the fourth biggest gainer of the S&P 500 in the last three months.However, in the first week of October, the high per barrel prices led to a decline in demand as we previously predicted, and the U.S. crude oil experienced its biggest weekly loss since March. Despite these fluctuations in the oil price, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts that Brent Crude oil per barrel price will average at around $84.09 and will be much higher in 2024 at $94.91.Story continuesIn the long run, the International Energy Agency (IEA) sees the fossil fuel demand drop by 25% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. The Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said in one of its reports that the oil and gas sector’s “fall has been long in the making.” It further added that the oil and gas sector covered around 29% of the S&P 500 in 1980 and is down to 5.3% today.The Global Race Toward Net-ZeroThe renewable energy sector faced some problems due to the inflationary pressures which led to higher borrowing rates and lower-than-expected investments. Even though the apprehension of inflation is still there, it is not as bad as last year. According to BloombergNEF data, global renewable energy investments were up 22% year-over-year in the first half of 2023 and reached $358 billion.The developed countries are transitioning toward renewable energy quicker than expected. In 2022, the US made $141 billion worth of investments in the sector and renewable energy accounted for 43% of the country’s global energy mix. France has also recently announced the fast-tracking of its renewable energy capacity and plans to double it by 2035. Bloomberg Law reported that the country is targeting an additional 140 to 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by that time.According to an IEA report posted in December 2022, renewable energy is forecasted to account for 90% of global electricity expansion over the next 5 years, and by 2025, it will surpass coal to become the largest source of electricity generation. Furthermore, IEA Executive Director, Fatih Birol, said that the amount of renewables added to electricity systems in 2023 will break records. He further added:“The global energy crisis has shown renewables are critical for making energy supplies not just cleaner but also more secure and affordable – and governments are responding with efforts to deploy them faster. However, achieving stronger growth means addressing some key challenges. Policies need to adapt to changing market conditions, and we need to upgrade and expand power grids to ensure we can take full advantage of solar and wind’s huge potential.”Analysts are also fairly bullish on the renewable energy sector as most of the undervalued energy stocks according to analysts in this list are mostly focusing on renewable energy. Some of the best undervalued energy stocks according to analysts include Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN), Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG), and Bloom Energy Corporation (NYSE:BE).12 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsA bustling natural gas terminal, capturing the busy flow of energy selling and distribution.

Here is what it said:\xa0“Currently, the portfolio has roughly 11% allocated across two utilities, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Polaris Renewable Energy. In the case of both equities, we have experienced disappointing 2023 market results, and in the case of AES, it is the long-book’s worst performer YTD, dragging down the overall portfolio by -2.09%. Polaris contributed a positive return of 0.21%. These two positions represent investments in similar assets but very different businesses, which explains much of the divergence in this year’s results.In the case of AES, we have a heavily US-focused utility with significant exposure to regulated and unregulated markets and a significant commitment to building out renewable energy. The firm also has some exposure to electricity markets in South America and exposure to electricity storage markets in the form of its ownership stake in Fluence (FLNC). Despite being one of the larger US utilities, the firm has trailed the sector (as measured by the IXUTR Index) dramatically this year…” (Click here to read the full text)11.

(NYSE:BIP) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Brookfield Corporation has $7.6 billion invested through Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP), a publicly traded permanent capital vehicle that is one of the largest owners and operators of critical global infrastructure. The entity was demerged from Brookfield in 2008 and was seeded with interests in 1.2 million acres of timberlands in Canada and the United States and interests in 10,900 kilometers of electricity transmission assets in Chile, Brazil, and Canada. The oldest of these assets, Great Lakes Power Transmission Co., an electricity transmission system based in Ontario, was acquired by Brascan in 1982. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners has significantly enhanced the quality, scale, and diversity of its portfolio over the last fifteen years. The timber assets were fully divested, and rail networks, toll roads, diversified terminals, last-mile utilities, midstream energy, and digital infrastructure were added. The partnership now owns many of the world’s premier infrastructure assets, several of which were acquired for value during a dislocation. For example, in 2020 Brookfield Infrastructure Partners acquired a six percent ownership interest in Sabine Pass, the largest LNG export facility in the United States. The transaction occurred amid unprecedented lows in natural gas pricing and an oversupplied LNG market. The partnership paid $1 billion for its interest, which was funded with forty percent equity and sixty percent low cost debt. In 2022, Sabine Pass generated $2.5 billion in earnings, or approximately $120 million in earnings against Brookfield Infrastructure Partners’ $400 million equity investment, equating to a thirty percent cash on cash yield…” (Click here to read the full text)\xa0Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\xa0Suggested articles:15 Countries with the Highest Rates of Lung CancerLong Term Returns of ValueAct Capital’s Activist Targets12 Best Penny Stocks to Buy Under $1Disclosure.

Fundamentally, the underlying industry offers critical services. As you know, bad things happen when people flip the switch and the light doesn’t turn on.On a practical level for investors, utility stocks to buy benefit richly from inelastic demand. No matter what happens in the economy, both households and businesses must pay the bills. This dynamic also means that utilities can raise prices and demand won’t drop significantly. Obviously, that’s a massive advantage ahead of market uncertainty.Also, utilities enjoy a natural monopoly. Due to the capital-intensive nature of the sector, not many companies can rival entrenched utilities. Also, you have an intense regulatory framework that dissuades competition.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow, to broaden the scope of this discussion, I’ve also included energy generators and service providers. While they might not be traditional utilities, they’re vital to the overall infrastructure. And on that note, below are intriguing utility stocks to buy.Public Service Enterprise (PEG)telephone poles and power lines with sunset as backdropSource: ShutterstockBased in Newark, New Jersey, Public Service Enterprise (NYSE:PEG) is a diversified energy firm. According to its public profile, the company is its state’s oldest and largest investor-owned utility firm. Since the beginning of the year, PEG lost almost 3% of equity value. Therefore, it’s not quite a market favorite. Still, the red ink also makes it an interesting idea for undervalued utility stocks.Looking at its financials, PEG trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 10.89x. That’s noticeably lower than the sector median of 14.37x. For full disclosure, Public Service doesn’t exactly distinguish itself from other utility stocks with sterling financials. As an example, it runs a high debt load, as evidenced by its cash-to-debt ratio of 0.03X.Story continuesNevertheless, what’s important here is its strong profit margins, particularly its net margin of 24%. Also, the company carries a forward yield of 3.77%.Analysts rate PEG a moderate buy with a $65.58 price target, implying over 8% upside potential.Vistra Energy (VST)solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background representing solar stocks.Source: chuyuss / Shutterstock.comAn integrated retail electricity and power generation firm, Vistra Energy (NYSE:VST) is one of the largest utility stocks. Featuring a multi-varied business, Vistra’s portfolio includes natural gas, nuclear power, solar, and battery energy storage facilities. Based in Irving, Texas, the company carries a market capitalization just north of $12 billion.One of the best-performing utility stocks to buy, VST gained nearly 47% of equity value since the January opener. On paper, that doesn’t sound like a bargain. Still, on a financial note, VST still trades at a forward earnings multiple of 8.28x. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 13.99x. In addition, the market prices VST shares at 0.77x trailing revenue, which is also undervalued.Now, with the upside performance, Vistra isn’t the most generous in terms of its forward yield at only 2.52%. Still, it’s better than nothing, especially ahead of a possible economic slowdown.Analysts peg VST a unanimous strong buy with a $37.29 target, implying 14% growth.Brookfield Renewable (BEPC)A phone displaying the logo for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC)Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockWhile not a traditional entry among utility stocks to buy, Brookfield Renewable (NYSE:BEPC) nevertheless deserves consideration thanks to its wider importance to energy generation. Per its website, Brookfield represents one of the world’s largest platforms for renewable power and decarbonization solutions. It also features a diversified portfolio, including wind solar, and hydroelectric power.However, the main drawback of BEPC from an investment standpoint is its volatility risk. Since the start of the year, shares stumbled 21%. And in the past five years, they’re down almost 15%, which has frustrated stakeholders. Still, from a financial perspective, its trailing-year earnings multiple without non-recurring items (NRI) sits at 6.49x. In contrast, the industry median value is 14.54x.Also, the company benefits from robust top-line expansion. Its three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 29%, beating out 78.57% of its rivals. Also, BEPC features a forward yield of 5.54%.Wells Fargo’s Jonathan Reeder rates shares a buy with a $34 target, implying almost 40% upside.AES (AES)Utilities stocks: a stock image of light fixtures; one lightbulb is lit upSource: ShutterstockThough one of the riskiest utility stocks to buy from a volatility standpoint, AES (NYSE:AES) could entice “conservative” gamblers, if that makes sense. Per its public profile, AES owns and operates power plants. Through these facilities, the company generates and sells electricity to end users and intermediaries, such as utilities and industrial entities.However, as alluded to earlier, a darker side exists to the AES narrative and that is its chart “performance.” Since the start of the year, shares have tumbled more than 48%. At the same time, AES is only down a fraction relative to the beginning of its trailing five-year period. Stated differently, shares could be substantially de-risked.If you prefer a by-the-numbers approach, AES trades at a forward earnings multiple of 7.89x. That’s much lower than the 13.44x forward price-earnings ratio of the regulated utility space. Also, the company provides a forward yield of 4.57% and a low payout ratio of 35.17%.Analysts rate AES a moderate buy with a $20.29 target, also implying almost 40% growth.TransAlta (TAC)Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, TransAlta (NYSE:TAC) is an electricity power generator and wholesale marketing firm. Per its corporate profile, TransAlta operates 76 power plants in Canada, the U.S., and Australia. Further, the company operates wind, hydroelectric, natural gas, and coal power generation facilities. Though relevant like other major utility stocks, TAC hasn’t quite enjoyed a strong outing in 2023.Since the January opener, TAC gave up more than 14% of equity value. To provide the heads-up, the negativity has been severe recently. In the trailing one-month period, TAC plunged 17%. Still, for adventurous investors, there is a de-risking argument to be had. But this too is a dangerous proposition since it may be a value trap.Based on the numbers, TAC trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple (without NRI) of 10.89x. Also, it trades at 0.82x trailing revenue. Both stats are considered undervalued. Given the relevance and the forward yield of 2.12%, it’s a tempting wager.Also, analysts peg TAC a unanimous strong buy with a $11.92 target, projecting over 56% upside.Fluence Energy (FLNC)FLNC stock. Concept of renewable energy battery storage system in nature. 3d renderingSource: petrmalinak / Shutterstock.comAnother enterprise that’s not traditionally considered one of the utility stocks, Fluence Energy (NASDAQ:FLNC) is akin to the medical staff for a professional baseball club. While Fluence might not be taking at-bats (to extend the analogy), it keeps the team viable over a long season. It does this through the development, deployment, and management of energy storage systems. These systems can be used by utilities to enhance grid reliability.Unlike some other pure-play utility stocks to buy, FLNC is a solid performer in the charts. Since the beginning of this year, shares swung up more than 17%. And in the past 365 days, it returned almost 37% of market value. Notably, FLNC trades at only 1.13x trailing sales, lower than 70.4% of its peers. That’s quite remarkable considering that Fluence’s three-year revenue growth rate soars at 109.8%.In fairness, the company’s other metrics are questionable, to be diplomatic. However, it does feature a robust cash-to-debt ratio of 5.62x.Lastly, analysts rate FLNC a moderate buy with a $31.86 target, implying nearly 68% growth.Opal Fuels (OPAL)Renewable natural gas image inside clear piggy bank.Source: InvestorPlaceAs with Fluence Energy above, Opal Fuels (NASDAQ:OPAL) wouldn’t technically be considered a candidate for utility stocks. However, if you’re willing to be a little less stringent than say the governing body of Formula 1 motor racing, you might be interested in learning about Opal. As a fully integrated leader in the production and distribution of low-carbon intensity renewable natural gas (RNG), the enterprise enjoys strong forward implications.As it relates to the subject at hand, utility firms and other industrial users are rapidly discovering the vast opportunities of RNG. Further, as political and social winds pressure policymakers, RNG may become an important component of both energy security and net-zero emissions directives. So, it’s worth putting on your radar, even though it’s inking a 9% loss year-to-date.Still, that also means OPAL trades at 9x trailing earnings. It also prints an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 23.9%.On a final note, analysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $12.09 target, projecting over 93% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Using the most recent financial data, we\'ll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don\'t get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for AES Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company\'s cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$574.0mUS$123.0mUS$243.0mUS$346.0mUS$426.2mUS$498.1mUS$560.2mUS$612.6mUS$656.7mUS$694.1mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 23.18%Est @ 16.87%Est @ 12.46%Est @ 9.36%Est @ 7.20%Est @ 5.68% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% -US$532US$106US$193US$255US$291US$315US$328US$333US$331US$324(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.9bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country\'s GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year \'growth\' period, we discount future cash flows to today\'s value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$694m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.2%) = US$12bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$12b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$5.7bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$7.7b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$13.8, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.The AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company\'s future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company\'s future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company\'s potential performance. Given that we are looking at AES as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we\'ve used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.155. Beta is a measure of a stock\'s volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for AESStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Renewable Energy market.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company is unprofitable.Revenue is forecast to decrease over the next 2 years.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It\'s not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you\'d apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company\'s valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Young, Vice President of Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Please go ahead.David Young: Good morning and welcome. This morning, we will be hearing remarks about the third quarter related to our operations in Japan and the United States from Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated, and Fred Crawford, President and COO of Aflac Incorporated. Max Broden, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated will provide an update on our financial results in current capital and liquidity, which can also be found with the materials that we posted along with our earnings release and financial supplement on investors.aflac.com. We also posted under financials on the same site updated slides of investment details related to our commercial real estate and middle market loans. In addition, Max provided his quarterly video update, which you will find there also.Other members of our executive management team who are joining us for Q&A include Virgil Miller, President of Aflac US; Charles Lake, Chairman and Representative Director, President of Aflac International; Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director, Aflac Life Insurance Japan; Brad Dyslin, Global Chief Investment Officer, President of Aflac Global Investments. Before we begin, some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discussed today. We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.Story continuesAs I mentioned earlier, the earnings release is available on investors.aflac.com and includes reconciliations of certain non-US GAAP measures. I'll now hand the call over to Dan. Dan?Dan Amos: Thank you, David. Good morning. We're glad you joined us. Reflecting on the third quarter of 2023, our management team, employees, and sales distribution have continued to work tirelessly as dedicated stewards of our business. This has allowed us to be there for the policyholders when they need us most, just as we promised. Aflac Incorporated delivered very strong earnings for both the quarter and for the first nine months. Beginning with Japan, I am pleased with our 12.4% year-over-year increase in sales, which was largely driven by a nearly 23% increase in cancer insurance sales, with a significant contribution from Japan Post Company and Japan Post Insurance. I am also pleased to see continued improvements in cancer insurance sales through our other alliances, Dai-ichi Life and Daido Life.These alliance partners, along with agencies and banks, combine to form our extensive distribution channels that are so important to being where the customer wants to buy insurance and providing them with financial protection. We continue to work hard to support each channel. We also introduced our new medical insurance product on September 19. The product design is simple to appeal to younger policyholders with basic needs and older or existing policyholders who desire additional or updated coverage. While it's too early to evaluate the success of this product launch, early indications show that it's being well received. We continue to gain new customers through WAYS and Child Endowment, while also increasing opportunities to sell our third sector products.Since the launch of our refreshed WAYS product, approximately 80% of our sales are to younger customers below the age of 50, and the level of concurrent third sector sales remains approximately 50%. Thus far, our product strategy in Japan has served us well, and I'm encouraged by our progress so far. Turning to the US, I'm encouraged by our sales increase of 7.5% in the quarter. This reflects continued productivity improvements and the contribution from our growth initiatives of group life and disability, consumer markets, network dental and vision. We remain focused on driving scale, stabilizing new platforms, and leveraging our ability to bundle essential product lines as we work with brokers on larger groups. Agents and brokers contributed to the growth of our individual business.Our group platform benefited significantly from the sales of group life and disability. I am very excited about our new cancer protection assurance policy, which provides enhanced benefits at no additional cost. We know that when people experience the value of our products, it increases persistency, which benefits our policyholders and lowers our expenses. I believe that the need for our products and solutions we offer is strong or stronger than ever before in both Japan and the United States. We are leveraging every opportunity and avenue to share this message with consumers, particularly given that our products are sold, not bought. As we communicate the value of our products, we know that a strong brand alone is not enough. We must paint a better picture of how our products help address the gap that people face when they get medical treatments, even though they may have major medical insurance.Knowing our products help lift people up when they need it most is something that makes all of us at Aflac very proud and propels us to do more and achieve more. We continue to reinforce our leading position and build on that momentum. As always, we are committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. We continue to generate strong investment results while remaining in a defensive position as we monitor evolving economic conditions. In addition, we have taken proactive steps in recent years to defend our cash flow and deployable capital against a weakening yen. As an insurance company, our primary responsibility is to fulfill the promises we make to our policyholders. At the same time, we are listening to our shareholders and understanding the importance of prudent liquidity and capital management.We remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of the policyholder and balance this financial strength with tactical capital deployment. I am very pleased with the Board's declaration of the fourth quarter dividend and declaring this dividend of 2023 marks the 41st consecutive year of dividend increases, a record that we treasure. I am even more pleased with the Board's action to increase the first quarter of 2024 dividend by 19% to $0.50 per share. We also remain in the market purchasing shares at a historically high level of $700 million, as seen in the first two quarters of this year. We intend to continue prudently managing our liquidity and capital to preserve the strength of our capital and cash flows, which support both our dividend track record and tactical share repurchase.Overall, I think we can say that it has been a very strong quarter, especially when a vast number of factors are in our favor. Aflac Japan had a strong quarter for sales as we executed product and distribution strategy. Aflac US continued to build on its momentum as it nears pre-pandemic levels. Pre-tax profit margins remain strong in both Japan at 32.8% and the US at 28.8%. Plus, our capital ratios remain very strong, and our quarterly share repurchase was, like last quarter, one of the largest in the company's history. Before I hand it over to Fred, I want to address an announcement of his retirement. I have enjoyed working closely with Fred over the last eight years and certainly understand his desire to retire and spend more time with the family and personal interests.Fred, you will be missed, and I look forward to working with you and Aflac's executive team to ensure a smooth transition until your official retirement day. And I wish you many happy years. As for me and the company, we have some outstanding candidates who are capable of running Aflac. It is my responsibility to continue to train and watch the progress of these potential heir apparent while the Board oversees the process. To be prepared for any unknowns, we have always had an interim CEO ready should something abruptly happen to me, as well as a strong process within the Board's corporate governance committee. I recently had a physical at Emory University and received an excellent report. So I plan on being around to prepare our leaders for the future and drive shareholder value.With that, I'll now turn the program over to Fred. Fred?A nurse talking on the phone with a client while assisting them in filling out paperwork for a medical insurance policy, demonstrating the company's dedication to customer service.Fred Crawford: Thank you, Dan. As announced last night, I plan to retire in September of next year to spend more time with my family and pursue other interests. It's a personal decision, but also a recognition of the very capable leadership team surrounding Dan and the company being in a very strong position. While I believe this is the best for me and my family, I also believe it is in the best interest of Aflac. I've enjoyed 25 years as an executive in the insurance industry and feel blessed to have worked with talented professionals and leaders throughout. However, the highlight has clearly been my time here working for Dan and for Aflac. Over the next year, I will be focused on transition and helping on select initiatives where I can add value. I'll now hand the call back over to Max. Max?Max Broden: Thank you, Fred. For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 27.8% year-over-year to $1.84 with a $0.06 negative impact from FX in the quarter. With this being the third quarter under the new LDTI accounting regime, we evaluate our reserve assumptions for morbidity, persistency, and mortality, at least annually, to see if an update is needed. If necessary, these assumptions will be unlocked on a prospective basis as they were in this quarter, leading to remeasurement gains of $205 million. Variable investment income ran $13 million or $0.02 per share below our long-term return expectations. We also wrote down certain software intangibles in our US segment, impacting our results by $0.04 per share.Adjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, increased 10.3%, and the adjusted ROE was 15.6%, a significant spread to our cost of capital. Overall, we view these results in the quarter as solid. Starting with our Japan segment, net earned premium for the quarter declined 2.8%, reflecting the impact of paid-up policies, our January 1 reinsurance transaction and deferred profit liability. Lapses were somewhat elevated but within our expectations. However, if adjusting for all these factors, the earned premium declined an estimated 1.7%. Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 65.1% for the quarter, down 170 basis points year-over-year, and the third sector benefit ratio was 54.8%, down approximately 460 basis points year-over-year.We continue to experience favorable actual to expected on our well-priced, large and mature in-force block. We estimate the impact from remeasurement gains to be 260 basis points favorable to the benefit ratio in Q3. Long-term experience trends as it relates to treatment of cancer and hospitalization continue to be in place, leading to favorable underwriting experience. Persistency remained solid with a rate of 93.5% but was down 80 basis points year-over-year. With product refreshments, we tend to experience some elevation in lapses as customers update and refresh their coverage, which was the case with the recently refreshed cancer and first sector products. Our expense ratio in Japan was 19%, down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by good expense control and, to some extent, by expense allowance from reinsurance transactions and DAC commission true-up.For the full year, we would expect to end up towards the low end of our expense ratio range of 20% to 22%. Adjusted net investment income in yen terms was up 7.2% as we experienced higher yields on our US dollar-denominated investments and related favorable FX and a return on our alternatives portfolio, more in line with our long-term return expectations. This was offset by transfer of assets due to reinsurance. In the quarter, we reduced our FX forwards and increased FX put options notional, leading to lower run rate hedge costs and a more efficient use of our investment risk capital. The pretax margin for Japan in the quarter was 32.8%, up 350 basis points year-over-year, a very good result for the quarter. Turning to US results, net earned premium was up 3.2%.Persistency increased 80 basis points year-over-year to 78.7%. This is a function of poor persistency quarters falling out of the metric and stabilization across numerous product categories, especially group voluntary benefits. Our total benefit ratio came in lower than expected at 35.9%, a full 890 basis points lower than Q3 2022. We estimate that the remeasurement gains impacted the benefit ratio by 12.1 percentage points in the quarter. Claims utilization remains subdued. And as we incorporate more recent experience into our reserve models, we have released some reserves. For the full year, we now estimate our benefit ratio to be materially below our outlook range of 47% to 50%. Excluding remeasurement gains, however, we are tracking well within the 47% to 50% outlook range.Our expense ratio in the US was 40.6%, up 70 basis points year-over-year. This includes a 190 basis points impact from a software intangibles write-down. Adjusting for this write-down, we are trending in the right direction. Our growth initiatives, group life and disability, network dental and vision, direct-to-consumer increased our total expense ratio by 330 basis points. We would expect this impact to decrease over time as these businesses grow to scale and improve their profitability. For the full year, we now expect our expense ratio to come in slightly above our outlook range of 37% to 40%. Adjusted net investment income in the US was up 13%, mainly driven by higher yields on both our fixed and floating rate portfolios and variable investment income in the quarter more in line with long-term return expectations.Profitability in the US segment was solid with a pretax margin of 28.8%, driven primarily by the remeasurement gains from unlocking. As you know, the commercial real estate markets are going through the worst cycle in decades, especially in the office subsector. We're seeing most property values quoted down 25% to 40%, but some distressed situations are driving market values down as much as 60%, far exceeding the 35% to 40% declines of the financial crisis. Our total commercial real estate watch list remains approximately $1 billion, with around two-thirds of these in active foreclosure proceedings. As a result of these current low valuation marks, we increased our CECL reserves associated with these loans by $34 million this quarter. We also moved two properties into real estate owned, which resulted in a $53 million write-down.We do not believe the current distressed market is indicative of the true intrinsic economic value of the underlying properties currently undergoing a foreclosure process. We continue to believe our ability to take ownership of these quality buildings and manage them through this cycle will allow us to maximize our recoveries. In our Corporate segment, we recorded a pretax loss of $49 million, which is somewhat smaller than a year ago, primarily due to our reinsurance transaction. Adjusted net investment income was $8 million lower than last year due to an increased volume of tax credit investments. Higher rates began to earn in and amortized hedge income increased. These tax credit investments impacted the corporate net investment income line for US GAAP purposes negatively by $64 million with an associated credit to the tax line.The net impact to our bottom line was a positive $3.8 million in the quarter. To date, these investments are performing well and in line with expectations. We are continuing to build out our reinsurance platform, and I'm pleased with the outcome and performance. In Q4, we intend to execute another tranche with similar structure and economics to our first transaction from January this year. Our capital position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR above 1,000% in Japan. And our combined RBC, while not finalized, we estimate to be greater than 650%. Unencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $3.3 billion, $1.6 billion above our minimum balance. These are strong capital ratios which we actively monitor, stress and manage to withstand credit cycles as well as external shocks.US stat impairments were $4 million and Japan FSA impairments JPY2.9 billion or roughly $20 million. This is well within our expectations and with limited impact to both earnings and capital. Leverage remains at a comfortable 18.8%, just below our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%. The decline in the quarter is primarily driven by the weakening yen. As we hold approximately two-thirds of our debt denominated in yen, our leverage will fluctuate with movements in the yen-dollar rate. This is intentional and part of our enterprise hedging program, protecting the economic value of Aflac Japan in US dollar terms. We repurchased $700 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $248 million in Q3, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments.We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital in order to drive strong risk-adjusted ROE with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital.

Employees want their employers to care about their overall wellbeing and provide resources to stay ahead of burnout, but the study shows their confidence is waning - causing some to consider other job opportunities.Consistent with 2022 survey findings, more than half (57%) of all American workers say they are currently experiencing at least moderate levels of burnout. The most significant culprit is workplace stress - with heavy workloads as the biggest stressor - and it\'s disproportionately affecting both women and younger workers. Other survey findings include:Employees\' confidence in how much their employers care about them has declined significantly: 48% in 2023; 56% in 2022; 59% in 2021.The overwhelming majority (89%) of employees who report high levels of burnout also have experienced other mental health challenges over the past year, including anxiety, depression and trouble sleeping, among others.67% of Gen Z and 64% of millennials say they are facing moderate to high levels of burnout.Women are vulnerable, too, with 75% reporting burnout at work as opposed to 58% of men.Story continues""Survey results on mental health and wellbeing in the workplace are alarming and continue to be challenging, but employers can face these challenges head-on and turn them into opportunities,"" said Jeri Hawthorne, senior vice president, chief human resources officer, Aflac Incorporated. ""Offering benefits that include mental health tools and resources, in addition to work-life balance perks, such as flexible work schedules, can help with employee satisfaction, retention and recruitment.""A balancing act for employersThe steady rise in benefits costs and looming concerns of increasing prices of everyday goods and services are causing employers to cautiously navigate balancing their benefits budgets, satisfying employees - and, more importantly than ever, retaining them. The study uncovered that 53% are at least somewhat likely to accept a position with lower pay but better benefits.""The cost of benefits is creating a ripple effect for employers,"" said Hawthorne. ""They want to remain competitive by offering benefits their employees are looking for while staying budget conscious. They\'re also faced with retention pressure and tough decisions to push expenses to employees, such as increasing employee deductibles or employees\' share of health insurance premiums.""The great divide in benefits satisfaction and understandingThe gaps are widening between employers\' perceptions and employees\' lived experiences with benefits satisfaction and understanding, according to the study. Key survey findings:78% of employers believe their employees are highly satisfied with their benefits, compared to only 59% of employees who express high satisfaction.79% of employers think employees understand benefits costs well, while fewer than half (48%) of employees say they do.""When employees do not fully understand the inner workings of their policies and health care costs, it\'s difficult for them to prepare for an unexpected medical event,"" said Hawthorne. ""It\'s important for employers to actively communicate about benefits year-round - not just during open enrollment periods.""Financial fragility, smarter choicesEmployees\' stress and anxiety about their financial health are caused not only by rising costs, but also by the potential of unexpected medical expenses. This has led employees to spend less and save more over the last year, according to the survey. More employees have financial resources on hand to cover a medical emergency, compared to last year; however, the state of financial wellness among American workers - and their outlook on the economy - remain fragile. Key survey findings:51% of employees have savings on hand for a medical bill - up from 45% in 2022 - but 50% can\'t afford more than $1,000 in out-of-pocket (OOP) medical expenses.54% of employees say they could survive a month without a paycheck, down from 62% in 2022.50% of employees think the economy is worse than it was a year ago; 30% indicate that they are in a worse financial position than they were a year ago.Financial instability disproportionately impacts Hispanic workers. Key survey findings:66% of all Hispanic workers could not go more than a month without a paycheck - compared to 51% of non-Hispanic workers.57% of Hispanic workers could not afford $1,000 in unexpected OOP health care-related costs, compared to 49% of non-Hispanic workers.When faced with an unexpected medical expense, Hispanic workers also would be more likely to have to rely on family or friends (29% vs. 24% of non-Hispanic workers) or seek a second job for supplemental income (26% vs. 18% of non-Hispanic workers).Hispanic workers are less likely than their non-Hispanic counterparts to be able to pull from a checking or savings account to cover unexpected medical expenses (43% vs. 53%).Meeting employees where they are in the digital spaceSurvey responses show employees\' needs are not being met when it comes to enrolling in and managing their benefits online. Most employers recognize the importance of having a benefits provider that offers a user-friendly, digital interface. A similar proportion of employees value the convenience of managing their benefits online. Key survey findings:82% of employees overall - and 87% of millennials - think it\'s important to enroll in and manage their benefits online.82% of employees stress the importance of being able to manage benefits online, yet 45% of employers do not offer the ability to enroll in benefits online.64% of organizations offer online benefits management, down from 67% in 2022 and 79% in 2021.8 in 10 employers indicate that it is very important for their benefits provider to be innovative and lead in digital technology.Nearly one-third of employees say they aren\'t comfortable working with AI to manage their benefits, whereas fewer employers (1 in 10) feel the same way.""Employers have an opportunity to build benefits programs their employees need and make it easy to navigate and manage their options online. Leaning into benefits providers who excel in digital technology can make a big difference and increase employee satisfaction,"" said Hawthorne.Supplemental insurance helps provide financial security and boosts recruitment, retentionSupplemental benefits that directly address employees\' anxieties about the future can be a compelling solution. According to the survey, more than half of all employees express a high degree of interest in purchasing supplemental health insurance that helps cover serious illnesses or conditions - if they have family history. This interest is higher among younger generations than baby boomers and significantly higher among Hispanic workers (62%), compared to their non-Hispanic counterparts (50%).According to the survey, the majority of employees (88%) with supplemental insurance say those benefits provide an added layer of financial security, yet only 39% of employers indicate that they offer supplemental insurance options to their employees. Of employers who offer supplemental insurance to their employees, 80% believe these benefits help with recruitment, and 82% say they help with retention.The 2023-2024 Aflac WorkForces Report highlights the important role benefits programs play in employees\' wellbeing and satisfaction. Supplemental insurance remains a core component of a comprehensive benefits package to help attract and retain employees. Employers will foster a more resilient workplace by understanding their employees\' needs and offering resources for mental health and financial wellbeing while leveraging innovative technology.Additional survey findings, demographic information, workplace trends and more can be found in the 2023-2024 Aflac WorkForces Report at Aflac.com/AWR.ABOUT THE 2023-2024 AFLAC WORKFORCES REPORT The 2023-2024 Aflac WorkForces Report, conducted by Kantar on behalf of Aflac, is the 13th annual study examining benefits trends, attitudes and use of employee benefits in the U.S. workforce in various industries and business sizes.

Net earnings were $1.6 billion, or $2.64 per diluted share, compared with $1.8 billion, or $2.82 per diluted share a year ago.Net earnings in the third quarter of 2023 included net investment gains of $423 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, compared with net investment gains of $199 million, or $0.31 per diluted share a year ago. These net investment gains were driven by net gains on certain derivatives and foreign currency activities of $381 million, largely driven by changes in exchange rates, a $47 million gain from an increase in the fair value of equity securities and $24 million of net gains from sales and redemptions. Net investment losses included a $29 million increase in the company\'s current expected credit losses (CECL) reserves and impairments.Adjusted earnings* in the third quarter were $1.1 billion, compared with $910 million in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting an increase of 20.3%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share* increased 27.8% to $1.84 in the quarter. Variable investment income ran $13\xa0million, or $0.02 per share, below the company\'s long-term return expectations. The weaker yen/dollar exchange rate negatively impacted adjusted earnings per share by $0.06.The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the third quarter of 2023 was 144.97, or 5.4% weaker than the average rate of 137.08 in the third quarter of 2022. For the first nine months, the average exchange rate was 138.38, or 8.5% weaker than the rate of 126.65 a year ago.Total investments and cash at the end of September 2023 were $111.3 billion, compared with $114.5 billion at September 30, 2022. The decline in the carrying amount of the portfolio is principally driven by the rise in interest rates and weakening of yen exchange rates.Story continuesShareholders\' equity was $22.7 billion, or $38.63 per share, at September 30, 2023, compared with $19.9 billion, or $31.97 per share, at September 30, 2022. Shareholders\' equity at the end of the third quarter included a cumulative decrease of $866 million\xa0for the effect of the change in discount rate assumptions on insurance reserves, compared with a corresponding cumulative decrease of $4.1\xa0billion at September 30, 2022 and a net unrealized loss on investment securities and derivatives of $427 million, compared with a net unrealized gain of $1.1 billion at September 30, 2022. Shareholders\' equity at the end of the third quarter also included an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of $4.5 billion, compared with an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of $4.4 billion at September 30, 2022. The annualized return on average shareholders\' equity in the third quarter was 29.1%.For the first nine months of 2023, total revenues were down 1.8% to $14.9 billion, compared with $15.2 billion in the first nine months of 2022. Net earnings were $4.4 billion, or $7.28 per diluted share, compared with $4.2 billion, or $6.57 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2022. Adjusted earnings for the first nine months of 2023 were $3.0 billion, or $4.97 per diluted share, compared with $2.8 billion, or $4.35 per diluted share, in 2022. Excluding the negative impact of $0.17 per share from the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 18.2% to $5.14 for the first nine months of 2023.Shareholders\' equity excluding AOCI (or adjusted book value*) was $28.4 billion, or $48.44 per share at September 30, 2023, compared with $27.5 billion, or $44.00 per share, at September 30, 2022. The annualized adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact* in the third quarter was 16.1%.AFLAC JAPANIn yen terms, Aflac Japan\'s net earned premiums were ¥285.3 billion for the quarter, or 2.8% lower than a year ago, mainly due to limited pay products reaching paid-up status and a reinsurance transaction in the first quarter partially offset by an unlock of future deferred profit liability assumptions. Adjusted net investment income increased 7.2% to ¥98.9 billion, mainly due to higher variable investment income and floating rate income. Total adjusted revenues in yen declined 0.5% to ¥385.4 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings in yen for the quarter increased 11.4% on a reported basis to ¥126.4 billion, primarily due to lower benefits and expenses partially offset by decreased revenue during the quarter. Pretax adjusted earnings increased 7.0% on a currency-neutral basis. The pretax adjusted profit margin for the Japan segment increased to 32.8%, compared with 29.3% a year ago.For the first nine months, net earned premiums in yen were ¥855.7 billion, or 5.0% lower than a year ago. Adjusted net investment income increased 0.9% to ¥267.8 billion. Total adjusted revenues in yen were down 3.6% to ¥1.1 trillion.

For the first nine months, total new sales increased 16.6% to ¥44.9 billion, or $325 million.AFLAC U.S.Aflac U.S. net earned premiums increased 3.2% to $1.4 billion in the third quarter compared to the prior year, reflecting the strong contribution from growth initiatives. Adjusted net investment income increased 13.0% to $209 million, largely due to higher variable investment income and a shift to higher-yielding fixed-income investments as well as increased floating rate income. Total adjusted revenues were up 3.9% to $1.7 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings were $478 million, 38.6% higher than a year ago, primarily due to lower benefits driven by actuarial assumption unlocks and higher adjusted net investment income, partially offset by higher adjusted expenses. Higher expenses reflected ongoing investments in the U.S. platform, as well as a write-off of certain capitalized software development costs in the third quarter of 2023. The pretax adjusted profit margin for the U.S. segment was 28.8%, compared with 21.6% a year ago.For the first nine months, net earned premiums increased 2.2% to $4.3 billion.

For the first nine months of the year, total new sales increased 6.4% to $998 million.CORPORATE AND OTHER For the quarter, total adjusted revenues increased 57.5% to $115 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the reinsurance transaction in the first quarter of 2023 resulting in an increase to total net earned premiums, partially offset by lower net investment income driven by a higher volume of tax credit investments. Pretax adjusted earnings were a loss of $49 million, compared with a loss of $56 million a year ago, reflecting the increase in adjusted revenue, partially offset by higher total net benefit and claims and other adjusted expenses.For the first nine months, total adjusted revenues increased 103.2% to $384 million. Pretax adjusted earnings were a loss of $107 million, compared with a loss of $173 million a year ago.DIVIDEND AND CAPITAL RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERSThe board of directors declared the fourth quarter dividend of $0.42 per share, payable on December\xa01, 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November\xa015, 2023, and the first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.50 per share, payable on March 1, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2024.In the third quarter, Aflac Incorporated deployed $700 million in capital to repurchase 9.4 million of its common shares.

Amos stated: ""Aflac delivered very strong earnings for both the quarter and the first nine months. We have continued to actively concentrate on numerous initiatives in the U.S. and Japan around new products and distribution strategies to set the stage for future growth.""Looking at our operations in Japan, I am pleased that our sales results reflect improvements through agencies and alliances, including Japan Post, Dai-ichi Life and Daido Life. While it\'s too soon to provide details about the new medical product we introduced in mid-September, early indications show that it is being well-received. Additionally, we see products like WAYS and Child Endowment as door-openers to gain new customers, which increases opportunities to sell our third sector products.""In the U.S., I remain encouraged by the continued improvement in the productivity of our agents and brokers as well as contribution from our growth initiatives, including group life and disability; network dental and vision; and consumer markets. As we enter into the fourth quarter, which is typically our strongest quarter of the year, we continue to work toward accelerating our momentum and reinforcing our leading position.""We continue to generate strong capital and cash flows while maintaining our commitment to prudent liquidity and capital management. I am very pleased that 2023 marks 41 consecutive years of dividend increases, a record we treasure. Additionally, I am very happy with the Board\'s decision to increase the first quarter 2024 dividend 19%. We also remained in the market repurchasing shares at the historically high levels of the first three quarters of this year. We intend to continue our balanced approach of investing in growth initiatives and to drive long-term operating efficiencies while preserving the strength of underlying cash flows, which supports our dividend track record and tactical share repurchase.""All relevant prior-year amounts have been adjusted for the adoption of accounting guidance on January 1, 2023 related to\xa0accounting for long-duration insurance contracts.*See Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures section for an explanation of foreign exchange and its impact on the financial statements and definitions of the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release, as well as a reconciliation of such non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.ABOUT AFLAC INCORPORATEDAflac Incorporated (NYSE: AFL), a Fortune 500 company, has helped provide financial protection and peace of mind for more than 67 years to millions of policyholders and customers through its subsidiaries in the U.S. and Japan.

The financial measures exclude items that the Company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with insurance operations.Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period. A significant portion of the Company\'s business is conducted in yen and never converted into dollars but translated into dollars for U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, which results in foreign currency impact to earnings, cash flows and book value on a U.S. GAAP basis. Management evaluates the Company\'s financial performance both including and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation to monitor, respectively, cumulative currency impacts and the currency-neutral operating performance over time. The average yen/dollar exchange rate is based on the published MUFG Bank, Ltd. telegraphic transfer middle rate (TTM).The company defines the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release as follows:Adjusted earnings are adjusted revenues less benefits and adjusted expenses. Adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are the adjusted earnings for the period divided by the weighted average outstanding shares (basic or diluted) for the period presented. The adjustments to both revenues and expenses account for certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside management\'s control. Adjusted revenues are U.S. GAAP total revenues excluding adjusted net investment gains and losses. Adjusted expenses are U.S. GAAP total acquisition and operating expenses including the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable but excluding any nonrecurring or other items not associated with the normal course of the Company\'s insurance operations and that do not reflect the Company\'s underlying business performance. Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to evaluate the financial performance of the Company\'s insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of these financial measures is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company\'s insurance business. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.Adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact are computed using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior-year period, which eliminates fluctuations driven solely by foreign currency exchange rate changes. Adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact important because a significant portion of the Company\'s business is conducted in Japan and foreign exchange rates are outside management\'s control; therefore, the Company believes it is important to understand the impact of translating foreign currency (primarily Japanese yen) into U.S. dollars. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.Adjusted return on equity is adjusted earnings divided by average shareholders\' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Management uses adjusted return on equity to evaluate the financial performance of the Company\'s insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of this financial measure is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company\'s insurance business. The Company considers adjusted return on equity important as it excludes components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management\'s control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted return on equity is return on average equity (ROE) as determined using net earnings and average total shareholders\' equity.Adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding the current period foreign currency impact divided by average shareholders\' equity, excluding AOCI. The Company considers adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact important as it excludes changes in foreign currency and components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management\'s control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is ROE as determined using net earnings and average total shareholders\' equity.Amortized hedge costs/income represent costs/income incurred or recognized as a result of using foreign currency derivatives to hedge certain foreign exchange risks in the Company\'s Japan segment or in Corporate and other. These amortized hedge costs/ income are estimated at the inception of the derivatives based on the specific terms of each contract and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge. The Company believes that amortized hedge costs/income measure the periodic currency risk management costs/income related to hedging certain foreign currency exchange risks and are an important component of net investment income. There is no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for amortized hedge costs/ income.Adjusted book value is the U.S. GAAP book value (representing total shareholders\' equity), less AOCI as recorded on the U.S. GAAP balance sheet. Adjusted book value per common share is adjusted book value at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share important as they exclude AOCI, which fluctuates due to market movements that are outside management\'s control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.Adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses is adjusted book value plus unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses. Adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses per common share is adjusted book value plus unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses, and its related per share financial measure, important as they exclude certain components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management\'s control; however, it includes the impact of foreign currency as a result of the significance of Aflac\'s Japan operation. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses and adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.Adjusted net investment income is net investment income adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, and ii) net interest cash flows from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are reclassified from net investment gains and losses to net investment income. The Company considers adjusted net investment income important because it provides a more comprehensive understanding of the costs and income associated with the Company\'s investments and related hedging strategies. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted net investment income is net investment income.Adjusted net investment gains and losses are net investment gains and losses adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, ii) net interest cash flows from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are both reclassified to net investment income, and iii) the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable, which is reclassified to interest expense as a component of total adjusted expenses.

(NYSE:A). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$128 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$103. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Agilent Technologies' current trading price of US$104 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Agilent Technologies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies What's The Opportunity In Agilent Technologies?According to my valuation model, Agilent Technologies seems to be fairly priced at around 18% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Agilent Technologies today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $126.93, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Agilent Technologies’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Agilent Technologies look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 49% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Agilent Technologies. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in A’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on A, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Agilent Technologies from their most recent forecasts.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies How Much Debt Does Agilent Technologies Carry?As you can see below, Agilent Technologies had US$2.79b of debt at July 2023, down from US$2.91b a year prior. However, it also had US$1.33b in cash, and so its net debt is US$1.46b.A Look At Agilent Technologies' LiabilitiesZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Agilent Technologies had liabilities of US$1.76b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$3.36b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$1.33b in cash and US$1.34b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$2.45b.Since publicly traded Agilent Technologies shares are worth a very impressive total of US$32.0b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Agilent Technologies's net debt is only 0.83 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 26.1 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. On the other hand, Agilent Technologies saw its EBIT drop by 6.7% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Agilent Technologies's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the last three years, Agilent Technologies recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 85% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.Our ViewThe good news is that Agilent Technologies's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its EBIT growth rate. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like Agilent Technologies is pretty sensible with its use of debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. We'd be motivated to research the stock further if we found out that Agilent Technologies insiders have bought shares recently. If you would too, then you're in luck, since today we're sharing our list of reported insider transactions for free.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE: A) today announced the company’s near and long-term targets for reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The targets support the ambitious goal to limit planetary warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.""Companies have an important role to play in driving the transition to a green economy,"" said Agilent President and CEO Mike McMullen. ""Having measurable goals for this work is critical to ensuring sustainable growth that will enable communities and business to thrive for generations to come.""SBTi is an independent organization that validates company emissions targets to ensure they meet the criteria required to prevent the worst effects of climate change. The SBTi partners with the CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute, and World Wide Fund for Nature in defining and validating targets grounded in climate science.Agilent publicly committed to net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets in 2021. This important goal was made in addition to adopting the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines in 2004, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) recommendations in 2020, and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework in 2021.Below are Agilent’s SBTi-approved targets, all of which are measured from a base year of 2019.2030 TargetsReduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50%Reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, capital goods, upstream transportation and distribution, business travel, and employee commuting by 30%2050 TargetReduce absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by 95%Since 2014, Agilent has reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by one third by investing in renewable energy sources, reducing energy consumption, and transitioning to energy-efficient systems and technology.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Agilent Technologies\'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company\'s shareholders. View our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders\' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Agilent Technologies is:20% = US$1.1b ÷ US$5.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The \'return\' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders\' capital it has, the company made $0.20 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.Agilent Technologies\' Earnings Growth And 20% ROETo start with, Agilent Technologies\' ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company\'s ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 13%. This probably laid the ground for Agilent Technologies\' moderate 14% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Agilent Technologies\' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company\'s growth is lower than the industry average growth of 21% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company\'s expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is A fairly valued? This infographic on the company\'s intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Agilent Technologies Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?In Agilent Technologies\' case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 20% (or a retention ratio of 80%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.Moreover, Agilent Technologies is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts\' estimates, we found that the company\'s future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 16%. However, Agilent Technologies\' ROE is predicted to rise to 27% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Agilent Technologies\' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

A strong recovery in the automotive sector, along with the growing proliferation of self-driving vehicles and solid prospects of the Advanced Driver Assistance System, is a tailwind to the industry players. The increasing adoption of software-enabled testing instruments and devices remains another positive. Industry participants like AMETEK, Fortive and Itron are well-poised to benefit from the aforementioned factors.However, the challenging global macroeconomic environment, end-market volatility, inflationary pressures, unfavorable forex and growing geo-political tensions are persistent concerns for the underlined industry.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Electronics – Testing Equipment industry comprises companies offering advanced instruments, electronic testing equipment solutions, thermal management systems, electrical connectors, motors and various test solutions. The major end markets served by this industry are consumer, automobile, industrial, aerospace and defense, healthcare, semiconductors and communications, to name a few. Industry participants have been making technological advancements to gain traction among semiconductors, vehicles, machinery, smartphones and medical device manufacturers, who are constantly increasing their spending on electronic components.4 Trends Shaping the Future of Electronics - Testing Equipment Industry5G Prospects a Boon: The growing deployment of 5G holds near-term promises for the industry players. Another major positive is an uptick in demand for 5G test solutions required for 5G deployment. The current coronavirus-triggered work-from-home and learn-from-home waves globally, which continue to bolster the demand for high-speed Internet services, bode well for electronic companies enhancing their 5G efforts.Story continuesThe growing number of high-speed data centers worldwide is another tailwind. Given the upbeat scenario, the industry is anticipated to remain on the growth trajectory, backed by solid efforts to reinforce the 5G strength.Solid Adoption of Motion Control & Test Systems is a Positive: The rising utilization of precision motion-control solutions and automatic test systems in motion-control devices and testing products, particularly in the aerospace, automation, medical and military markets, is an upside. Further, commercial motor and autonomous vehicles will likely continue to buoy demand for vehicle-tracking systems, fleet-management solutions and other private fleet applications, which are part of the industry's key offerings.Synergies in the Pharmaceutical Market Are Tailwinds: The industry is steadily gaining from the increasing use of electrical instruments and software to interrogate the biological properties of molecules and cells in clinical and medical science research. The rapid adoption of the solutions is anticipated to drive growth for participants in the pharmaceutical end market.Agilent is capitalizing on the trend and gaining traction in the life science research space. The pharmaceutical market holds immense prospects, courtesy of the growing utilization of electronic testing equipment. Rising demand for RF test equipment by medical device manufacturers is another uptrend.Macroeconomic Headwinds Pose Concerns: Rising inflationary pressure and fears of global recession have negatively impacted the rate of deal wins. Due to the challenging macroeconomic scenario, enterprises are reluctant to sign multi-year deals worldwide. These trends do not bode well for industry participants.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Electronics – Testing Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 7. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of gases for industrial, medical and other uses is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.6%.Revenues are expected to be $3.31 billion, down 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.78% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Air Products and Chemicals?For Air Products and Chemicals, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.97%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Air Products and Chemicals will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Air Products and Chemicals would post earnings of $2.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.98, delivering a surprise of +2.41%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Air Products and Chemicals doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, Avient (AVNT) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.57 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -3.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $783.26 million, down 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Avient has been revised 1.9% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.59%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Avient will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The best hydrogen stocks to buy on this list have bright futures ahead of them, so you don’t want to miss out.Here are our top picks for October.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPlug Power (PLUG)Person holding cellphone with logo of American hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc on screen in front of web page Focus on phone displaySource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.comPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) specializes in hydrogen fuel cell technology. Despite facing a significant drop in stock value over the past year, the company has ambitious targets, aiming for substantial revenue growth in the coming years.Like other hydrogen stocks on this list, the stock price of PLUG plunged due to fears of rising long-term Treasury bond yields. These companies, sensitive to interest rates, are impacted by surging bond yields, threatening their valuations and capital-raising abilities.However, given its long-term growth outlook, the company’s stock appears to be attractively valued. With ambitious revenue targets and a focus on green hydrogen production, the company seems poised for a potential rebound and long-term growth.\xa0This helps make it one of the best hydrogen stocks to buy.Air Products and Chemicals (APD)Air Products truck on motorway.

The company benefits from sustained volume improvement and increased hydrogen demand, particularly in the Americas. The company maintains a Buy rating, with a recommended buying range of around $250-$260 for long-term investors.Story continuesAPD stock trades at 28.2 times earnings. This makes it relatively undervalued compared to previous years, and its fundamentals have improved since then, making it a stock to watch.Bloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) specializes in solid oxide fuel cell technology for distributed electricity and hydrogen generation.

However,\xa0hydrogen stocks\xa0have not been top performers in the last few quarters. That’s understandable as markets go through down cycles and it’s applicable even for specific sectors. I believe that the correction in hydrogen stocks is a good opportunity to accumulate for the next few years.Some of the best hydrogen stocks are poised to deliver multi-bagger returns due to stellar revenue growth. To put things into perspective, global “spend on producing hydrogen\xa0for energy purposes from now until 2050 will be USD 6.8tn, with an additional USD 180bn spent on hydrogen pipelines.” The growth story will span over several decades. The revenue for some of the best hydrogen companies is the tip of the iceberg.Let’s explore three hydrogen stocks that look attractive for long-term exposure.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPlug Power (PLUG)Person holding mobile phone with logo of American hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. (PLUIG) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comPlug Power\xa0(NASDAQ:PLUG) stock has plunged by 61% in the last 12 months. I believe that PLUG stock is attractively valued considering the Company’s long-term growth outlook. It’s worth noting that the short interest in the stock remains high at 23%. I would not be surprised with a big short squeeze rally from current levels of $6.6.Coming to the financial roadmap, Plug Power has ambitious targets. For the current year, the Company expects revenue of $1.2 billion. The\xa0guidance is for revenue\xa0of $6 billion and $20 billion in 2027 and 2030 respectively. Further, Plug Power expects a gross margin of 35% by 2030.While the targets are steep, industry tailwinds are positive. It’s a risk worth taking and multibagger returns seem likely. In August, the Company showcased the\xa0world’s first 15TPD green hydrogen plant. Business progress has been in the right direction and I don’t see financing growth as a concern.Story continuesAir Products and Chemicals (APD)Air Products truck on motorway. APD stock.Source: Bjoern Wylezich / ShutterstockAir Products and Chemicals\xa0(NYSE:APD) has remained mostly sideways year-to-date. The 2.47% dividend yield stock looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 24.4. With aggressive investments planned towards building the hydrogen economy, Air Product is likely to be a value creator.Air Products and AES have agreed to build the largest green hydrogen facility in North Texas. With an\xa0investment of $4 billion, the facility will have a capacity of 200mt/day. The Company will also be constructing a\xa01.2 million tonne per year green hydrogen facility in Saudi Arabia, which will be the largest in the world. Additionally, the Company is\xa0investing in a blue hydrogen hub\xa0in Western Canada.The key point to note is that Air Products has high financial flexibility and I expect continued investments. This sets the stage for healthy revenue growth and cash flow upside in the next five years.Bloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockBloom Energy\xa0(NYSE:BE) stock has remained depressed for year-to-date. It’s among the hydrogen stocks that are worth accumulating. As an overview, Bloom Energy has a solid oxide platform for distributed generation of electricity and hydrogen.The Company’s Solid Oxide Fuel Cells have already been deployed in applications across healthcare, data centers, critical manufacturing, and retailers. The solid oxide platform already has\xa0more than 700 installations globally. With a big addressable market, the growth outlook is positive.For Q2 2023, Bloom Energy reported revenue growth of 23.8% on a year-on-year basis to $301.1 million. However, Bloom Energy reported an operating loss of $54.5 million for the quarter. The positive is that the Company has\xa0guided for a positive non-GAAP operating margin\xa0for 2023. With operating leverage, I expect sustained margin expansion.As of Q2 2023, Bloom reported cash and equivalents of $900 million. This provides the Company with high financial flexibility to invest in deepening the product pipeline. Some of the\xa0recent launches include Series 10\xa0and an enhanced CHP solution for net zero heating and cooling.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Compass Minerals is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Air Products and Chemicals has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CMP likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than APD has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.CMP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.60, while APD has a forward P/E of 22.08. We also note that CMP has a PEG ratio of 0.31. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. APD currently has a PEG ratio of 2.16.Another notable valuation metric for CMP is its P/B ratio of 2.11. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, APD has a P/B of 4.10.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help CMP earn a Value grade of A, while APD has been given a Value grade of C.CMP is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that CMP is likely the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The change, of course, is the advent of the green economy, and the switch from fossil fuel energy sources to renewable energy. While wind and solar power are soaking up the headlines, a more plausible long-term green power source is already near at hand: hydrogen.Hydrogen is the most abundant of all the chemical elements, and also the simplest by molecular structure. It is found everywhere; with carbon and oxygen, it forms the basis of the organic compounds that make life possible, and in the heart of the sun, its nuclear fusion generates the light and energy on which we all depend. Without hydrogen, we couldn’t exist.Hydrogen also offers high potential as fuel. It is highly reactive, and amenable to our technological control. As a fuel, it can be burned with oxygen to release both light and heat; as an element in fuel cells, it can generate clean electricity. Being so common, relatively simple technological processes – electrolysis powered from renewable sources and steam methane reforming associated with carbon capture and storage, to produce ‘green’ and ‘blue’ hydrogen respectively – can produce hydrogen at scale for industry and utilities.A recent report from Deutsche Bank’s David Begleiter points out that, due to recent initiatives of the Biden Administration, it pays for companies to produce clean hydrogen. The Department of Energy has announced $7 billion in funding for regional clean hydrogen hubs in the US, and the US government is working to promote demand for clean hydrogen.Begleiter, a 5-star analyst, has also been pointing out stocks that stand to gain as hydrogen use expands. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to look up the details on two of those picks, producers and distributors of industrial gasses, that are leaders in the sector – and that investors should watch them closely.Linde plc (LIN)Linde, the first company we’re looking at, was founded in Germany and traces its roots back to 1879. Today, the firm operates with a global footprint and has become the leading provider of atmospheric gases – argon, nitrogen, and oxygen – for industrial use, as well as other pure gases such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and methanol. The company’s products have found uses in aquaculture, agriculture, chemistry, construction, electronics, healthcare; there is hardly a sector of our economy that does not make use of gases in some way.Story continuesAll of this isn’t just big business, it is huge. Linde has a market cap of $185 billion and generated over $33 billion in total revenues last year. Its gas business is supplemented by engineering services, in separating and pressurizing gases, developing and building systems for the liquefaction and storage of gases, thermal processes for recovering gases from industrial feedstocks, and developing the specialist equipment for the manufacture of industrial gases.When it comes to hydrogen, Linde has the long-term experience, the technical expertise, and the existing infrastructure to rapidly generate the gas in large quantities, to store it safely, and to ship it when and where it is needed. Linde already provides hydrogen for several industrial applications, including aviation, heavy industry, mobility, and power buffering.Linde’s oversized footprint in the industrial gas niche has been beneficial for both the company and its investors. Earnings are trending upward in recent quarters, and the firm’s stock is up 18% year-to-date. In its last quarterly financial release, for 2Q23, Linde showed an adjusted EPS of $3.57, beating the forecast by 9 cents and growing 15% from the prior-year quarter. The top-line result, however, was down ~5% year-over-year and missed the estimates by $500 million.For analyst Begleiter, all of this can be summed up in a simple list of achievements: “With Linde executing well on pricing and productivity, 18 consecutive earnings beats, a highly resilient business model, a $50B-plus and growing slate of clean energy investment opportunities and valuation a fair 27.0x ’23E EPS and 16.6x ’23E EBITDA, we reiterate our Buy rating.”That Buy rating comes along with a $450 price target suggesting ~19% one-year upside potential for the stock. (To watch Begleiter’s track record, click here)Overall, Linde gets a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, supported by a decisive 13 to 1 Buy-over-Hold margin among the 14 analyst reviews on record. The shares are trading for $379.24, and the $434.86 average target price points toward ~15% upside on the one-year horizon. (See Linde stock forecast)Air Products and Chemicals (APD)Next up is Air Products and Chemicals, a Pennsylvania-based industrial gas firm. Like Linde above, Air Products provides a wide range of gases, including hydrogen, helium, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, as well as the common atmospheric gases argon, nitrogen, and oxygen, along with the engineering and storage expertise to use them efficiently. The company’s products are found across the economy, in electronics, food and beverage, cement and lime, pulp and paper, rubber and plastics, food and medicine – the list is nearly endless.By the numbers, Air Products has an impressive footprint. The company operates in over 50 countries, employing more than 21,000 people to serve over 200,000 industrial customers. APD generates its products in a network of 750+ facilities and can transport gases through 1,800 miles of pipelines. The company posted $12.7 billion in sales for fiscal year 2022 and has ~$64 billion market cap.Earlier this year, Air Products announced that it had ‘closed the deal’ on an agreement with two partners, ACWA Power and NEOM Green Hydrogen, in the development of the world’s largest green hydrogen production facility. Air Products and NEOM concluded contracts worth $6.7 billion for engineering, procurement, and construction activities in the project.This announcement was only the latest in Air Products’ hydrogen activities. The company is deeply connected to the North American green hydrogen industry as part of its work to create a decarbonized economy.Air Products reported its results for Q3 of the fiscal year 2023 in early August, showing revenue of $3.03 billion. This was down 5% year-on-year and came in $260 million below expectations. However, the company’s bottom line was stronger. Earnings have been rising gradually over the past several quarters, and the fiscal Q3 2023 bottom line was $2.98, up 13.7% from fiscal Q3 2022 and 7 cents better than had been anticipated.Once again, we’re looking at a gas stock that Deutsche Bank’s David Begleiter sees in a generally bullish position. The analyst writes of Air Products, “With a large, green (blue/green hydrogen, carbon capture, SAF) and project backlog underpinning Air Products’ energy transition growth strategy and providing a line of sight to 10%-plus EPS growth over the next 5 years, a growing track record of large project execution and valuation a fair 22.3x ’24E EPS, we reiterate our Buy rating.”Looking ahead, Begleiter gives the shares a price target of $330 to go along with the Buy rating, implying a 15% potential gain in the coming year.Zooming out, we find that Air Products shares get a Moderate Buy consensus from the Street, based on 7 reviews that break down to 4 Buys and 3 Holds. The stock’s average price target of $328.71 suggests a gain of 14.5% from the current selling price of $287.12.

AKAM,"[""AKAMZacks Equity ResearchNovember 2, 2023 at 8:56 AM·2 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowAKAMWatchlistAnalysts on Wall Street project that Akamai Technologies (AKAM) will announce quarterly earnings of $1.51 per share in its forthcoming report, representing an increase of 19.8% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $944.57 million, increasing 7.1% from the same quarter last year.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has undergone a downward revision of 0.1% in the past 30 days, bringing it to its present level. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.Ahead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.While it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.Bearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific Akamai Technologies metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.The average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Security' at $442.07 million. The estimate suggests a change of +16.5% year over year.Analysts forecast 'Revenue- Compute' to reach $128.53 million. The estimate suggests a change of +17.8% year over year.The combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Revenue- Delivery' will likely reach $373.98 million. The estimate suggests a change of -4.9% year over year.View all Key Company Metrics for Akamai Technologies here>>>Over the past month, shares of Akamai Technologies have returned -2.5% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.1% change.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 7. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cloud services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19.8%.Revenues are expected to be $944.57 million, up 7.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.11% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Akamai Technologies?For Akamai Technologies, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.33%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Akamai Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Akamai Technologies would post earnings of $1.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.49, delivering a surprise of +5.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Akamai Technologies doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsTrueCar (TRUE), another stock in the Zacks Internet - Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.07 for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +53.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $41.16 million, up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for TrueCar has been revised 11.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -53.85%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that TrueCar will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance.

The new centers offer world-class distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection to regional and global organizations, government institutions, and critical public infrastructure.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)This announcement is part of Akamai\'s strategy to strengthen its Prolexic DDoS protection platform with a network of cloud scrubbing centers across 32 global metropolitan areas, offering a staggering 20+ Tbps of dedicated defense capacity. To put this in perspective: Even the largest DDoS attacks make up less than 10% of the defense capacity offered by the Prolexic platform.\xa0The local scrubbing centers in Toronto and Montreal deliver several additional benefits to customers in the region, including:Minimizing latency and maximizing network performanceOptimizing operational costs related to network traffic redirectionEnhancing visibility into and control over the region-specific patterns of DDoS attacksCanada has experienced a significant increase in the scale and sophistication of cyberthreats\xa0in the past three years. According to a recent survey, more than two-thirds of Canadian business executives believe that cybercrime will be their most significant threat in the coming year.\xa0In September 2023, the websites of several Canadian provincial governments were brought down by DDoS attacks. Additionally, DDoS attacks on the Canada Border Services Agency disrupted the operations of check-in kiosks and electronic gates across multiple airports. The recent spate of DDoS attacks resulted in an alert for IT professionals and managers from the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security.DDoS has become a relatively inexpensive, but highly effective, cyberattack tool for motivated cybercriminals, state-sponsored hackers, and other malicious actors, who often use such attacks as a smoke screen to then launch triple extortion attacks. To offer the most comprehensive DDoS protection, Akamai recently announced the launch of Akamai Prolexic On-Prem and Akamai Prolexic Hybrid options, which empower customers in the region to leverage the combined benefits of the ultra-low latency and automated surgical DDoS mitigation of on-prem appliances while still getting the scale of the Prolexic cloud to stop volumetric DDoS attacks.Story continues""Over the past two years, DDoS attacks have become bigger, highly sophisticated, and multi-vector in nature. The Akamai Prolexic platform offers comprehensive on-prem, cloud, or hybrid DDoS protection to protect our customers\' digital infrastructure and internet-facing assets,"" said Sean Lyons, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Infrastructure Security at Akamai. ""The new scrubbing centers in Toronto and Montreal bring DDoS protection even closer to our Canadian customers, allowing Akamai to deliver world-class security without impacting latency and end-user experience.""About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

Given the proliferation of digital crimes, targeting security solutions almost represents a no-brainer.First, investors must realize just how bad the situation has become. Worryingly, experts in the field reported that the global cost of cybercrime came out to more than $8 trillion last year. By the end of this year, the figure could exceed $11 trillion. That’s a massive wake-up call that utterly incentivizes the consideration of the top cybersecurity stocks.Second, we’re seeing the devastation of the digital crime wave accelerate to unprecedented levels. Perhaps most notably, Clorox (NYSE:CLX) recently revealed the extent of the damage it suffered from a digital breach earlier this year. Conspicuously, the damage inflicted by ransomware clocks in at 57X more destructive in 2021 than in 2015.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn that note, below are the best cybersecurity stocks to buy in October 2023.Akamai (AKAM)building facade with akamai (AKAM) logo on it. representing tech stocksSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comSpecializing in providing global content delivery network (CDN) services, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) also specializes in cybersecurity and cloud-based solutions. It’s a major player among the best cybersecurity stocks to buy thanks to its influence on web traffic visibility. Given Akamai’s CDN footprint, it handles a large portion of the world’s web traffic. Thus, it’s able to identify and mitigate new threats quickly.In addition, Akamai provides distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack protection, which can overwhelm websites and online services. As well, the company offers a web application firewall (WAF) that protects web applications from common attacks by monitoring and filtering traffic and blocking malicious incoming traffic.Story continuesThanks to its vitality, investors have poured into AKAM, sending it up nearly 27% on a year-to-date basis. However, AKAM still trades at 16.8x forward earnings, lower than the sector median of 22x.\xa0Analysts peg AKAM as a consensus moderate buy with a $111.54 target, implying about 4% upside. Still, that could be on the low side given the vast importance of the underlying business.Okta (OKTA)OKTA Stock: 4 Reasons To Like Okta Ahead Of EarningsSource: ShutterstockAn identity and access management firm, Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) ranks among the top cybersecurity stocks thanks to its authentication protocols. Through Okta, enterprise-level clients can manage and secure user authentication into various applications. Also, developers can build these controls for their platforms, web services, and devices. All this occurs under a unified, cloud-based umbrella that effectively allows companies to connect the right folks to the right technologies.In addition, Okta represents a leader in multi-factor authentication (MFA). Under this protocol, users must provide multiple forms of identification before gaining access to protected functions. Therefore, this security measure helps impede unauthorized entities from gaining access to sensitive information, even if these nefarious agents manage to crack passwords.Now, nothing in life is free and with that, it must be said that OKTA trades at a forward multiple of nearly 52X. That ranks worse than 81% of its peers, per investment data aggregator Gurufocus. However, for that premium, investors enjoy an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 33%.Analysts rate OKTA a consensus moderate buy with a $93.17 target, implying 8% growth potential.CyberArk Software (CYBR)CyberArk stockSource: ShutterstockAn information security specialist, CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) also focuses on identity management. Per its public profile, CyberArk mainly serves the financial services, energy, retail, healthcare, and government markets. It also features an international footprint, with offices throughout the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia-Pacific/Japan. Since the start of the year, CYBR stormed to a 35% return.Fundamentally, CyberArk symbolizes one of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy now thanks to its acumen in privileged access management (PAM). This protocol provides control and monitoring solutions for use access within an organization. Further, CyberArk ensures that sensitive credentials (for example, administrator accounts) are properly secured, monitored, and managed. Any anomalies can be dealt with immediately, mitigating digital breaches.Like other top cybersecurity stocks, CYBR comes at a hefty valuation of 122x forward earnings. Further, its longer-term revenue growth isn’t that impressive compared to its peers. However, it’s been expanding the top line robustly in recent quarters, making it worth a look.\xa0Finally, analysts believe in CYBR, pegging it a strong buy with a $189.30 target, implying 11% growth.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

We wonder if and what role the company\'s financials play in that price change as a company\'s long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Akamai Technologies\'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company\'s shareholders. See our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders\' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Akamai Technologies is:11% = US$478m ÷ US$4.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The \'return\' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder\'s investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Akamai Technologies\' Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo begin with, Akamai Technologies seems to have a respectable ROE. Be that as it may, the company\'s ROE is still quite lower than the industry average of 16%. Akamai Technologies was still able to see a decent net income growth of 12% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also does lend some color to the fairly high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Akamai Technologies\' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company\'s growth is lower than the industry average growth of 23% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company\'s expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for AKAM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Akamai Technologies Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Akamai Technologies doesn\'t pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Akamai Technologies has some positive aspects to its business. Particularly, its earnings have grown respectably as we saw earlier, which was likely achieved due to the company reinvesting most of its earnings at a decent rate of return, to grow its business. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company\'s earnings are expected to accelerate.

If you want to skip our introduction to the metals industry and the determinants of its performance, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Metals Stocks To Invest In. The metal industry is the backbone of the global economy. And conversely, the global economy is also a key determinant of the industry's performance. This is because the biggest users of metals are industries, which rely on them to build heavy duty industrial products such as jet engines, excavators, and crawlers. Industries are joined by the construction industry which is one of the biggest users of steel in the world. While steel is not directly a metal, it relies on iron since the material is actually a compound that mixes carbon and iron to increase durability and strength.Naturally, metal stocks fluctuate with global investor sentiment about the economy. Robust economic output means that there is more construction and greater industrial activity which leads to greater demand for metals and more revenue for the firms. In 2023, the key question on metal investors' minds is the outlook for China. China is one of the biggest infrastructure spenders in the world, and its Belt and Road initiative is a maze of roads that seeks to connect countries together and help maintain Chinese industrial output. This year, the metal industry has slowed down due to turmoil in the Chinese construction sector. Data shows that the Chinese property segment accounts for a whopping 20% of global steel demand, 18% of aluminum demand, and 6% of copper demand.Yet, the Chinese construction industry's effects on the metal industry aren't the first disruption that the sector has faced over the recent months. In fact, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine also had a negative effect on the sector. An uptick in demand for metals and materials such as nickel and steel created disruption in the market and made metals prices, as measured by the World Bank’s Metals and Minerals Price Index, rise by 13% during the first quarter of 2022. On an individual basis, prices of iron ore, aluminum, nickel, tin, and zinc rose by 27%, 18%, 35%, 12%, and 11% respectively on an annual basis in March 2022.Story continuesThe metals sector is not only important for today's industries but also for industries of the future. This is primarily due to the importance of one of the softest and most volatile metals you're likely to find, lithium, and its criticality to the electric vehicle industry. As you're likely to know, lithium is essential for battery production due to its electro-chemical properties. This demand implies that global lithium demand could grow by as much as ten times between 2021 and 2030 according to estimates from the consulting firm McKinsey. It believes that global lithium carbonate demand can grow from 500 thousand metric tons in 2021 to 5 million metric tons by 2030, and lithium companies will have to utilize innovative manufacturing technologies to ensure that they are able to meet demand. If you're interested in learning more about the global lithium industry and the countries that can dominate it in the future, then you can read Lithium Reserves by Country: Top 15 Countries.Additionally, while lithium is often considered to be the most important metal for the global shift to renewable energy, the reality is that without iron the world might find it difficult to reduce its reliance on polluting energy. Iron is important for the renewable energy sector since it is used to make steel, and we've explained this in detail as part of our 10 Metals Stocks with Insider Buying coverage. If you're wondering about the top three stocks in this list, then these are Paramount Gold Nevada Corp. (NYSE:PZG), Trilogy Metals Inc. (NYSE:TMQ), and TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ:TMC).Shifting gears, another metal that has been in the spotlight ever since the U.S. dollar started to appreciate in the wake of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate is gold. Gold is a multi purpose metal that is used in electronics manufacturing, decoration, and finance. Gold prices rise if investors expect interest rates to come down since the dollar drops, and vice versa.As for the outlook for gold, here's what the management of\xa0Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM) had to say during the firm's second quarter of 2023 earnings call:Strong commodity prices, coupled with our solid production base, resulted in revenue of $265 million and a gross margin of $152 million. Of this revenue, 56% was attributable to gold, 41% to silver, 2% to palladium, and 1% to cobalt. As at June 30, 2023, approximately 103,000 GEOs were in PBND and cobalt inventory, representing approximately 2.1 months of payable production, which is a level that is consistent with the preceding four quarters. G&A expenses amounted to $10 million for the second quarter, and the company anticipates that G&A will amount to $40 to $43 million for the year. Adjusted net earnings amounted to $143 million, a $7 million decrease relative to the second quarter of 2022. It is worth noting, though, that when comparing the results to the prior year, the estimated impact to net earnings associated with the relative changes in PBND was $18 million, meaning we would have exceeded prior year’s net earnings if not for the timing of deliveries.So, with the third quarter earnings season for the metal industry nearly with us, we decided to take a look at the top metal stocks to buy with the top three picks being Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM).12 Best Metal Stocks To Invest InA close-up of a modern semiconductor chip, intricately wired and gold plated.

Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 1.7%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns. View our latest analysis for Alcoa Alcoa's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. Despite not generating a profit, Alcoa is still paying a dividend. The company is also yet to generate cash flow, so the dividend sustainability is definitely questionable.Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 1.2%, so there isn't too much pressure on the dividend.Alcoa Doesn't Have A Long Payment HistoryThe dividend has been pretty stable looking back, but the company hasn't been paying one for very long. This makes it tough to judge how it would fare through a full economic cycle. The most recent annual payment of $0.40 is about the same as the annual payment 2 years ago. Alcoa hasn't been paying a dividend for very long, so we wouldn't get to excited about its record of growth just yet.Alcoa May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. However, Alcoa's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year.Alcoa's Dividend Doesn't Look GreatIn summary, while it is good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we think that at current levels the payment isn't particularly sustainable. The company's earnings aren't high enough to be making such big distributions, and it isn't backed up by strong growth or consistency either. We don't think that this is a great candidate to be an income stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from competition or inflation.

Before we get started, I want to acknowledge the important contributions from our former CEO, Roy Harvey. Roy played a key role in our evolution into a stronger and more resilient business and he was pivotal in our 2016 launch as a pure-play upstream aluminum company. He led the company through some difficult market environments, including COVID and his commitment to making Alcoa successful never wavered. He is serving as a strategic advisor to me for the remainder of the year and I appreciate his counsel. I've interacted with many of you over my 23 years with Alcoa Inc and Alcoa Corp both in my CFO and COO roles, and I'm glad to be with you again today.In my first few weeks in this role, I've met with employees, customers, and industry participants. Several questions keep coming up in those conversations such as what are our priorities and what are Alcoa's key challenges. First, to address the constant in our company, our values. At Alcoa, we act with integrity, operate with excellence, care for people, and lead with courage. These aren't statements that simply live on a plaque. These are the values we expect every Alcoan to live daily. I'm proud to lead the company guided by strong values. Our relentless focus on the safety of our employees, contractors, and visitors to our sites will continue as will our efforts toward our sustainability targets. As I step into the CEO role, I want to make it clear that I have an ambition for this company, an ambition manifests as an expectation of excellence in everything we do from EH&S, operations, maintenance, and commercial excellence.Alcoa has an impressive history of innovation and leadership in the industry and we plan to further build on that and strengthen our market connections. We will be action-oriented and make decisions guided by our values, sound business principles and with a focus on creating value for our stockholders. We've made good progress this year. Across our system, we've improved stability, and we intend to build on that operational momentum. So for the near term, the focus will be gaining approvals for bauxite mining in Western Australia. This is our top priority, we are making progress. We have the right team in place for success and we understand the improvements that our stakeholders are expecting. We will be driving for further operational improvements in Brazil.The ongoing start-up at the Alumar smelter in Sao Luis hasn't gone as planned. We now have conditions in place for a successful restart from here forward. Next, we will be focusing on productivity across our system with every site focused on margin improvements through operational productivity going into 2024. And we have action plans in place to improve the financial results of certain locations in the system that have been underperforming. Each operation is working to become more globally competitive. In the long-term, we remain bullish on aluminum as a material of choice. Mega-trends continue to drive increased aluminum usage globally from further EV penetration to the substantial future demand in solar installations. Alcoa is uniquely positioned in the aluminum industry for a world focused on carbon emissions and other sustainability issues which we are addressing from three vectors.Primary metal production with our joint venture ELYSIS, post-consumer scrap usage with our ASTRAEA technology, and carbon and residue emissions with our refinery of the future initiative. So before I address the third quarter results, let me re-emphasize. We are laser-focused on improving the short-term and we are working on developing unmatched, industry-leading technology for the long-term. Let's begin with safety. I am disappointed that we had one serious injury with life-altering implications in the third quarter. A worker at our Juruti bauxite mine lost portions of two fingers while performing maintenance on a bulldozer. While this event is unacceptable, overall, we are making progress on preventing fatalities and serious injuries. So far this year, our total recordable injury rate has improved by 16%, and days away and restricted time injury or DART rate is 27% better on a year-over-year basis.Also, we are increasing the number of onsite field verifications for leaders to evaluate the effectiveness of critical safety controls and coach workers on safety improvements. Now, moving to the financials. We reported an adjusted net loss for the third quarter of $1.14 per share and $70 million in adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items driven by lower average realized prices for both alumina and aluminum. Improvements in both raw material and production costs did not fully offset the impact from lower realized pricing in both of our segments. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and a cash balance of $926 million. We've made meaningful progress on our approvals for bauxite mining in Australia during the quarter and have more visibility on the timeline for decisions from the government and regulators.I will address this more fully later. In our operations, our Quebec smelter system set production records in the quarter, and we're investing there to increase our casting capabilities for value-added products. From a commercial perspective, we also continue to be encouraged by the reception from customers for our Sustana line of low-carbon products which includes EcoLum metal and EcoSource alumina. And while demand in some key end markets remained soft, there are signals for a rebound in 2024. We'll talk more about that macroeconomic view of the market in a moment, but first, let me turn it over now to our CFO. Molly, please go ahead.Molly Beerman: Thank you, Bill. Revenue was down 3% to $2.6 billion as higher shipments only partially offset lower realized prices for both alumina and aluminum. The net loss attributable to Alcoa increased $66 million, to $168 million and the loss per share increased from $0.57 to $0.94. On an adjusted basis, the net loss attributable to Alcoa increased $140 million to $202 million. The difference in net loss is primarily related to the reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in Iceland. Adjusted EBITDA declined $67 million to $70 million as part of the decrease in revenue was offset by lower costs. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. Third quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA declined $67 million to $70 million as lower metal and alumina realized prices were only partially offset by lower raw materials energy and production costs.Alumina segment EBITDA increased $20 million sequentially lower raw material costs, primarily caustic soda and lower production costs in Brazil and Spain, more than offset lower alumina index prices. We also saw the benefit of lower raw materials and production costs in the Aluminum segment as well as energy improvements, but not enough to overcome the impact of lower metal prices. Other costs outside the segments were unfavorable $56 million. They reflect unfavorable inter-segment eliminations, higher transformation demolition costs and higher other corporate costs. Here's a deeper dive on raw material costs. This year we've seen substantial improvement in our segment EBITDA due to lower prices for our key raw materials. Market prices for caustic soda, calcined petroleum coke, and coal tar pitch continued to decline in the quarter and are expected to improve further.Company-wide, we have seen an $86 million EBITDA improvement over the first nine months, $32 million in the Alumina segment and $55 million in the Aluminum segment. These lower raw materials market prices worked through our financials on a lag basis to expect further improvement in the fourth quarter. Let's now move to other key financial metrics. Our key financial metrics are consistent with our earnings results. Year-to-date return on equity is negative 8.7%. Our third quarter dividend added $18 million to stockholder capital returns, which totaled $54 million year-to-date. Free cash flow less net NCI contribution was negative $36 million in the quarter increasing proportional adjusted net debt by $0.1 billion and decreasing the cash balance by a similar amount.Year-to-date capital expenditures and cash income taxes remained our largest use of cash. In the third quarter, days working capital improved five days to 50 days on lower inventories. The improved working capital performance provides a significant source of cash in the third quarter entirely offsetting the previous year-to-date working capital cash use. The working capital improvement is evident on the next slide. Cash balance declined $64 million in the quarter. The largest source of cash was a working capital reduction of $183 million primarily from lower inventories followed by EBITDA of $70 million and net non-controlling interest contributions of $40 million. We expect working capital to be a source of cash in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were the largest use of cash at $145 million as CapEx typically increases as we move through the year.Notable this quarter were settlement payments of $75 million to former workers at two smelters that Alcoa previously owned in Spain, as well as environmental and ARO spending of $52 million. Let's turn to the outlook for the final quarter of 2023. Our full-year outlook has one favorable adjustment. We expect other corporate expense to improve $10 million to $120 million. At the segment level, in alumina we expect an improvement of approximately $50 million due to lower raw material prices, better production costs and higher volumes. Partially offset by approximately $10 million and higher energy costs. In addition, we expect impacts related to lower bauxite grades in Australia to be consistent with the prior two quarters. In the Aluminum segment, we expect unfavorable energy impact of approximately $30 million mainly due to CO2 compensation changes in Norway.Additionally, we expect $35 million in raw material price improvement to be offset by unfavorable product mix and higher production costs. Finally, alumina costs in the Aluminum segment are expected to be favorable by $5 million. Below EBITDA, note that the third quarter other expenses included one-time negative impact of $35 million primarily foreign currency losses. And we expect the fourth quarter operational tax to range between $10 million to $20 million. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill.William Oplinger: Thank you, Molly. Next, I'd like to recap some key items from our global operations. Each of the three smelters in Quebec, Deschambault, Baie Comeau, and ABI in Becancour have set year-to-date production records for tons per day. When totalled together they have performed the best since our 2016 separation. This week, one of those smelters, ABI announced the planned investment to further improve its casting capabilities for a broader array of alloys for value-added products. The new equipment should enable us to deliver products with additional sizes, smoother surfaces and better dimensional control for the automotive and packaging markets. We are also focused on operational improvements from assets across our global system driven by productivity enhancements.We took our first action last month at our Kwinana refinery in Western Australia with the restructuring plan that is intended to improve that facility and save $10 million annually with more improvements under consideration. In Brazil, we are employing a deliberate and methodical approach to the Alumar smelter restart, which is now operating at approximately 65% of the site's total capacity and has restored stability to the parts that have been restarted. Finally, we are committed to conformance with the global industry standard on tailings management. Alcoa has voluntarily disclosed information from all of our global tailings and we've worked with the International Council on Mining and Metals or ICMM to improve the industry's management of tailings.This has been a significant undertaking and we've worked diligently including with third-party reviewers to provide additional information about impoundments with the highest classification ratings before an August deadlines set for ICMM members. Now let's turn to an update on our mining approvals in Western Australia. Our teams have continued to work with relevant state government departments to advance our annual approvals for bauxite mining at the Huntly and Willowdale mines. Securing an approval is an absolute priority for our Company and we are working toward a final resolution in the fourth quarter. We've submitted a revised mine management program or MMP for the period '23 to 2027. This updated MMP is now being reviewed by regulators.We believe this revised plan meets evolving stakeholder needs as it includes numerous enhancements designed to specifically address expectations of the government. It includes additional controls for the protection of drinking water, including increased distances from reservoirs, and addresses biodiversity concerns through a plan to accelerate rehabilitation. Separately, let me briefly discuss the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority process. In August, the agency completed a public consultation period on whether it should assess all or part of the current and next MMPs. The WA EPA has indicated that it expects to decide on this before the end of the year. We have demonstrated our commitment to transitioning to a more modernized approvals framework for new major mine regions.That's why we proactively began a formal assessment in 2020 from the WA EPA for our two new major regions for the Huntly mine, Myara North and Holyoake. But this will take some time. The assessment for Myara North and Holyoake is ongoing and we do not expect the first bauxite ore from these new regions any earlier than 2027. We do expect the bauxite grade from these regions to be more consistent with the higher grades we previously experienced at the existing Myara central. However, until then we expect similar bauxite quality as compared to recent grades. As Molly described we are actively working to mitigate the financial impacts of these lower grades, while also looking for opportunities to optimize productivity. Next slide, let's move to some highlights from a commercial perspective and discuss some demand trends.First, customers are increasing demand for our Sustana line of products, the Sustana line is a small but growing proportion of our overall sales volume. Sales of EcoLum, our low carbon aluminum is strong in Europe and orders are being placed in North America too. Overall, we expect our annual global sales volume for EcoLum to increase approximately 60% for 2023 when compared to last year. Also, in the third quarter, we made our first sale of the non-metallurgical variety of EcoSource, our low-carbon Alumina brand. Earlier this year, we started offering non-metallurgical varieties in addition to existing smelter-grade EcoSource. Alcoa is one of the world's largest producers of non-metallurgical alumina, which is used in everything from refractories, sandpaper and water treatment processes across the world.Our Sustana line has the aluminum industry's most comprehensive portfolio due to the range of products we offer from alumina to metal. Meanwhile, we also have customers coming to us due to our history of alloy development. Last month, we were recognized for the second year in a row with an award from the North American Dye Casting Association for an Alcoa-developed alloy used in mega castings for electric vehicles. We are selling and licensing alloys that can be used to make these one-piece high-pressure dye castings. With our alloys, OEMs can get a one-piece casting rather than many separate pieces creating greater efficiency. On the cost side, our energy team signed a new nine-year power agreement in August that will cover 50% of Portland's smelter capacity starting in July of 2026.We continue to pursue options for the smelter's remaining electricity requirements with a strong focus on renewable energy. The global alumina and aluminum markets are both balanced to a slight surplus. At the same time, aluminum inventories in terms of days of consumption remained at historically low levels, positioning the market well for when demand improves. In 2024, there is uncertainty in the markets due to a range of geopolitical and macroeconomic factors, one of the biggest questions revolves around demand outside of China. Our base views is for continued growth in transportation and recovery in the packaging and in the building and construction sector. Within transportation, the automotive market typically drives the major trends. At this point, most of the COVID-related automotive supply chain disruptions have resolved.While uncertainty remains due to labor actions in the United States, we anticipate year-on-year growth in tons for aluminum as automotive production continues to ramp up to 2019 levels. In packaging, downstream inventory levels have largely normalized and we expect demand increasing. In building and construction, high-interest rates have negatively affected that sector in the last year, particularly in North America and Europe. A relative recovery in building and construction is expected next year compared to 2023. This is based on analysts' projections for slowing inflation and stabilizing interest rates, which should provide a better foundation for increased year-over-year activity although, the pace of that improvement remains uncertain and reliance on economic conditions.In closing, we are encouraged by the positive operational momentum in the third quarter and intend to build on that performance. Our Company's primary objective is to gain approvals for bauxite mining in Western Australia. We believe we're on the right path with an updated mine plan that has an enhanced commitment meant to address the government's expectations. And importantly, we now have line of sight to decision timing which is expected before the end of the year. Across our global operations, we are focused on improvement. We will work to increase productivity, reduce and control costs, and manage our working capital. We also are continuing work on our future-focused breakthrough technology programs, which have the potential to further differentiate our company.And finally, while some end-use sectors for aluminum are softer now, we remain bullish on the long-term fundamentals for our markets. I'm not alone in this view. I attended LME Week where the prevailing view was that aluminum is poised for long-term growth. Alcoa is well-positioned for the future. We have the distinct advantage of being active in all aspects of upstream aluminum production and I'm excited about our prospects and the work ahead. With that Molly and I are ready to take your questions.See also 16 Best Investing Podcasts in 2023 and 20 Most Innovative States in the US.Q&A SessionOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.Lawson Winder: Hello. Thank you, operator. Good evening, Bill and Molly. Bill congratulations on your new role.William Oplinger: Thank you, Lawson.Lawson Winder: Yeah, it's very nice to hear from you today. I just wanted to ask about Kwinana and just with the lower grades now expected to continue through 2027 at the earliest, is there a point at which a complete shutdown could become a high probability of risk?William Oplinger: So, at Kwinana we're essentially looking at all options, and in the near term as you see, we've announced a restructuring that takes some cost out. In addition to that, we're looking at a variety of different levers to be pulled to drive cost down and improve profitability there. But ultimately, as with any marginal asset and Kwinana is a marginal asset at this point, you know, we'll consider options on the table, including curtailment and closure.Lawson Winder: Okay, that's very clear. And then in a similar vein, Alcoa has had this goal of reducing its cost to first quartile level globally. You know, with you now in the lead seat, what are your thoughts on that goal in terms of timing and achievability? Thank you.William Oplinger: Thanks, Lawson. I think we, first of all, if you step back and look at where crew has us today on the cost curve, we are still first quartile bauxite mining, first quartile refining, and second quartile smelting. The current situation in Western Australia puts pressure on the refining segment. So that could move us into the second quartile. But to answer your question very specifically you see in the presentation that we did today we highlighted productivity and competitiveness a couple of times in the presentation. We have launched a program across the company to enhance competitiveness plant by plant and so we're essentially going after that. I think there's opportunities even in our best plants and we highlighted the great success that we've had in Quebec so far this year. I still think there's opportunities to make those plants more competitive, take cost out, and more productive. So we'll continue to strive for those targets.Lawson Winder: Okay, thank you very much. I'll get back in the queue.William Oplinger: Thanks, Lawson.Operator: The next question is from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.Lucas Pipes: Thank you so much operator. Bill, I'd like to add my congratulations. Thank you also for taking my question. And I wanted to pick up with the last question left off on the competitiveness. Can you maybe add a little bit more detail on what else you can tweak, is there capital needed to modernize plants, is it streamlining some of the labor relationships, is it energy? If you could maybe just peel the onion a little bit further, would really appreciate your perspective. Thank you.William Oplinger: Yes. Sure. So, we will peel the onion back a little bit. We -- and the plants are at varying stages of where they sit on this effort. Probably the earliest one to undertake it was Kwinana given some of the difficulties that we're having at Kwinana. We're looking at Kwinana from two perspectives. The first is an overall profitability perspective, where we were looking at are there additional markets that we can address because Kwinana has NMA capability or non-metallurgical alumina capability. Are there opportunities for pricing improvements for specific products, but then on the cost side, it's about labor productivity and maintenance productivity, so really getting down not these upon. But to get down to the nuts and bolts of trying to determine ROE effective on the maintenance side.And can we significantly improve our wrench time, so that was the work that's being done at Kwinana. We subsequently launched what we're calling workforce blueprint exercise and it started in some of our best facilities up in Quebec and you say, why start in some of your best facilities because I think if we can get gains in places like Quebec that are really, really performing well, we can probably get better games in other parts of the system. So that is actually going through and looking at the labor that we have and the amount of time it takes to do a specific tasks and a very scientific comparison of the people that we have in each plant and whether there's opportunities across the system to streamline and take cost out.Lucas Pipes: Thank you very much for that color. I want to follow-up on Western Australia, a couple of quick questions there. First, I think the company had previously guided to I think 2024 at the earliest, in terms of a transition back to higher grades, now 2027, could you remind us what changed, why three more years? And then if there is a kind of formal assessment at the EPA level in Western Australia, could that change the timeline, would appreciate your thoughts on that. Thank you.William Oplinger: Sure. So if we address kind of the suite of questions that you have, I think, we made good progress in the third quarter on this issue. We have been working with the government, and we've been working with the agencies and the government to get our annual mine approvals processed, we've submitted what's called a revised mine management program for '23 to 2027 with the enhancements that we talked about in the presentation. And essentially where that gets us to is that we expect that decisions will be taken this quarter, both on the mine plan approvals and the EPA assessment process. So I think it's a big step forward for the company, we should have some clarity this quarter. Now to address your question about what changed between our prior guidance and today's guidance, if you go back and look at our prior guidance we are very careful to note that there was not great clarity beyond 12 and 18 months, so we were essentially saying, hey, the -- we're expecting the lower grades for 12 to 18 month period.Since that time, with the concessions that we have made in the MMP process, we now have some better clarity. We've been able to work those concessions through the mine plans and the mine models. And we've developed the detailed plans for the most economic ways to mine the areas, that are now, that we believe are likely to be assessable under the approvals. And even with our best thoughts as far as mining and blending plans, we can get back to the historical grades that we've seen prior times. However, as we transition to Myara North, we believe that the geological sampling in those new regions will support the better grades that transition will occur, we expect in the '27 timeframe. I hope that addresses your question.Lucas Pipes: That is very helpful. There are more questions here, but I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you so much and best of luck.William Oplinger: Okay, thanks.Operator: The next question is from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.Michael Dudas: Good afternoon Jim, Bill, Molly.William Oplinger: Hey, Michael.Molly Beerman: Hey, Michael.Michael Dudas: Bill, can you just share some thoughts since you were promoted to the Chief Operating Officer earlier this year. I guess maybe six to seven months in that job and what did you find out after moving from the finance chair about the company and I'm assuming some of these implementations were your ideas. And then how you could translate that as CEO to allow Alcoa to capture more of the anticipated cost reductions and likely and hopefully pricing improvements that should run through the business in a more normalized environment over the next couple of years.William Oplinger: So what I found out when I transitioned from a long stint as the CFO, 10 years as the CFO into what turned out to be a short stint in the COO role was a couple of things. First of all, I was happy to find that we have great people in operations. We have people who have long tenure, you know, 20, 30 years with the company that have tremendous institutional knowledge. But we've also brought in a lot of newer people who see things in new ways, and do things new ways. So I was really pleased to get to see that. And just as an aside, loved my COO role for eight months. The other thing that I learned there was a tremendous amount of opportunity out there and people were really wanting to do things differently, wanting to aggressively address some things and so I thought there was tremendous amount of opportunity.So if I transition to some thoughts around the CEO role just to be clear, and I'm sure this question may be was embedded in your original question or will be asked later on, the strategy and direction of the company is largely unchanged. We know where we're going from a strategic perspective. The thing that I'm trying to drive as CEO and you see this changing over the last year or so is really a cultural change that cultural change is making decisions at a faster pace. It's having a performance orientation in everything we do. And really an expectation of excellence in everything we do and I hit upon this in my prepared remarks, whether it's operations maintenance, finance, an expectation of really being excellent. If we then couple that with what I think are the inherent advantages of Alcoa, so some of the inherent advantages of our company.We are present in all aspects of the value chain. We're a pure-play aluminum company. We're not spending time on other parts of battery minerals, we are focused exclusively on being successful in Aluminum. We have a global presence and back to that first part of the question, I think we have unmatched technical expertise still in this company. We haven't really shown it in the last couple of years on the operations side. But I think it's there and we're starting to show it now. So when I combine all of that, I translate that into an ambition for the company that we want to re-establish ourselves as the premier aluminum company in the world. And I think we can do that and not to go on too long, Michael. I'm really excited and I'm really happy to be in the role that I am in.Michael Dudas: Appreciate those observations. Looking out how quickly do you think you can implement the culture and, you know, kind of get best practices throughout the organization and productivity enhancements to show meaningful results or achieve those goals. Is it a three months, six months a year, is it something that can -- how urgent do you see that process even though the overall strategy has not changed?William Oplinger: Right, so Rome wasn't built in a day. We're not going to change the culture of this company in a day or a week or a quarter. However, look at the bridge that Molly showed, we saw production cost improvements for the first time in a long time in the third quarter and just so you understand how that bridge works, that's largely because we were able to make the tons. And so we were able to make the tons in the third quarter and the guidance that she gave was a pretty strong guidance with the exception of the carbon change from the Norwegian government which is totally outside of our control. So I think we're seeing some of that change today already and I think you'll see more in the future and everybody I talk to within Alcoa, hears the story of performance culture.We're trying to drive a performance culture and it's all about having expectations of excellence and driving those expectations of excellence and I think we've seen that on the upside to some extent. We've set records in Quebec. We're getting better stability in places like Brazil and the restart, much significantly better stability, and operational performance in our Western Australia assets, even though they have worse bauxite quality. So I think we're seeing it now and hopefully accelerate into the future.Michael Dudas: Excellent, Bill. Thank you.Operator: The next question is from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Bill Peterson: Yeah, hi, good afternoon, thanks for taking the questions and, you know, Bill, good luck in the new role.William Oplinger: Thanks, Bill.Bill Peterson: So I wanted to take a step back to maybe more macro supply demand. So you just said you mentioned at LME. I guess what's the latest you've seen in terms of supply demand balance, I guess in the context of restarts in Yunnan, you know, relatively weak, you know, macro backdrop. And then I guess maybe on the end market demand side, where are you seeing most resilience and then what remains most muted and any sort of color between regions?William Oplinger: So, 2023 is going to go down as a pretty tough year for the aluminum industry. In 2023, we see a slight surplus on the aluminum side. On Alumina it's fairly balanced and so, you know, on the aluminum side, we see about an 800,000 ton surplus in 2023. The reason for that is demand in rest of world -- rest of world actually contracted in 2023. So some of the big demand drivers in the rest of world that we've seen this year are really a reduction -- significant reduction in building and construction, actually a reduction of demand in packaging of all places, ever so slight and so across the board, we're seeing some weakness in the end markets. Now, you referenced my trip to the LME where pretty resoundingly what we hear amongst all the industry players is that 2023 and maybe going into 2024 can still be difficult times for aluminum, but it's just a matter of time where aluminum has a significantly better market environment.The reason why we see that as that demand continues to grow, starting to see even in 2024, a rebound in places like building and construction, some of the destocking that we saw occur in can sheet is now over. So, we should see a rebound in demand there. And we fundamentally believe that the Chinese cap on supply will be maintained at the 45 million metric tons, and we can address why we believe that. But over time, we see that the market fundamentals for the metal itself are really driven by some of the macro trends over the longer period of time with the EVs and solar, should be significantly better than they are today. But with that said, it's been a pretty tough year on demand in aluminum.Bill Peterson: That's great color. I may have missed it, but I believe last quarter you -- there was an update about San Ciprian discussing the planned phase restart to start at the beginning of 2024 with full restart by October '25. And then we're obviously trying to basically capture and set the PPA's in motion. But can you give us an update there, again, I may have missed it, but I didn't see that in the prepared remarks.William Oplinger: Yeah, so let me, let me give you an update. We continue to work toward really achieving the long-term economic viability of the site in Spain. And that -- and in the case of the smelter that allows for a restart in 2024. However, as basically the question that you just asked, we are starting -- we see significant challenges that need to be overcome for that site to be viable, including soft demand for the value-add products, that site makes slab and billet, low aluminum prices in this -- in the case of Europe high power costs and delay in permitting, and construction of some of the alternative power supplies that we had been looking at. We hope to overcome these challenges to allow for a progressive restart through the end of 2025, but it's been and it remains very difficult. So that's the situation in Spain.Bill Peterson: Okay, thanks again, and best wishes here moving forward.William Oplinger: Thank you.Operator: The next question is from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Independent Research. Please go ahead.John Tumazos: Thank you very much for taking my question. Comparing to the containerboard market today, International Paper announced they were shutting 900,000 tons or about 2.5% of US supply. In the world of aluminum market, obviously, China is 59% of output and some of the other continents don't have very much production left. The bigger other regions are Russia which is hydro, Canada which is hydro, India which is coal, and the Persian Gulf which is gas. Do you think it's possible to have a 2.5% supply reduction event in the world of aluminum industry the way it's structured today?William Oplinger: John, that's a hard question and give me just a second to formulate an answer.John Tumazos: Sure. I'm sorry to compare, there's never been a 10% non-recessionary fall in the containerboard industry before. It took that industry a long time to get a grip on it and aluminum isn't down 10%, it's just not growing the way would be normal.William Oplinger: So let me give you and you and I have known each other a long time and we've both been around this industry for a long time. So, let me give you a qualitative historical perspective. This industry has not had a problem on the demand side with the exception of the global financial crisis where we saw demand fall off and then inventories build. This year we've seen demand fall off and yet inventories have not built -- been built significantly. So inventories and whether they're -- whether they're on the LME or on the market or off-market inventories remain historically pretty low. As we look forward, we see a rebound of demand going into 2024 and really see strong demand trends that are driven by the mega-trends going out into the future.The question has historically been, will the Chinese maintain the 45 million metric ton cap? We are seeing indications that we believe that they will maintain that cap. If they do maintain that cap and demand continues to grow, that should assist the fundamentals of the industry. As far as a significant and to address your question on 2.5% cut in supply, the areas around the world where supply is under -- is under pressure, specifically is in Europe and we know that there are some plants that have hedged, that those hedges will be rolling off over time. We have our own challenged plant in Europe and so, you know, it remains to be seen whether the industry takes 2.5% cut out or not.John Tumazos: Thank you. We're all looking for demand, Bill.William Oplinger: Yeah, thanks. Thanks, John, and it was good to talk with you.John Tumazos: Thank you.Operator: The next question is from Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.Alexander Hacking: Yeah. Thanks, Jim, Bill and Molly and let me add my congratulations, Bill, on the new role.William Oplinger: Thanks, Alex.Alexander Hacking: Just following up on WA right, so it seems like we're in the low grades now until 2027. As we think about, you know, the mine moves north that are going to start, you know, producing or mining in 2027, what are the major risk factors around that, how should we think about that and how should we think about the timeline, because if you're going to be mining in 2027, I assume you need, you know, infrastructure, pre-stripping all kinds of things that are going need to be done ahead of that. So I guess, how should we think about the risks and timelines? Thanks.William Oplinger: So, Molly and I are going to team up on this one a little bit. The permitting process that we have undertaken for the Myara North move is what's called a part four permitting process. It is a modernized recognized permitting process within Western Australia for starting a new mine site and it requires a lot of information, and so we made that choice going back, I think it was in 2020 to move that modernized process for Myara North. We made that choice because we recognized that the customized process that we have currently really needed to be modernized and our stakeholders wanted the more modernized process. So the risk that I see is around that permitting process. Now, we're doing everything that we can to mitigate that risk and when we get closer to that time period, we will have line of sight.I can tell you we are very energized around reducing the time between when we get that permit to go and when we open up the mine phase. And given the fact that we've had some delays in permitting, we're really trying to focus our efforts on making sure that we minimize that time between getting the permit and actually getting bauxite out of the ground. So Molly anything you want to add to that?Molly Beerman: No, I'll just add as far as our guidance on the about $45 million impact that we're currently seeing in the quarter, we have plans to continue to mitigate that number, you saw the first action announced this quarter with Kwinana's severence program there, so that, that will save $10 million, and it's just the first bit of announcement. But we will keep moving through and finding productivity enhancements or portfolio changes to work that number down.Alexander Hacking: Hi. Thanks, that's helpful. I guess when you talk about, you know, the permits obviously being the key risk. You know, if I remember correctly, there are some, you know, potential issues with proximity to local communities. You know, are there other, you know, major permitting hurdles that you could foresee, I know this is a very kind of generic question, but, you know, any more color would be helpful. Thanks.William Oplinger: Not forecasting any issues around the part four process per se, but let me give you color around some of the concessions that we've made in the current process. The current MMP process, which we anticipate to be decided by the end of this year. We've added additional controls for protection of drinking water. We have agreed on distances from mining a certain distance from some of the key reservoirs and we've agreed to accelerating rehabilitation, and to increase the biodiversity in the near-term on the rehab. So those are the three areas that we have been discussing with the stakeholders and to try to get the current mine approvals through the process.Alexander Hacking: Okay, thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on Alumar if I may. I think the message last quarter there was, you fixed the conveyor issues and, you know, above 60%, has something else gone wrong in the last quarter or are you still on track from where you were then? Thanks.William Oplinger: Something big happened in Brazil in the quarter, there was a massive power outage. And if you follow our competitor there, Alunorte had the same issue, Albras had the same issue. We lost power for close to three and half hours in the smelter at Alumar. And that has knock-on impacts, not only on the smelter but on the refinery too. Now, thank goodness we had good stability, we had recovered stability going into that. We were able to get through that power outage, you know, what happens in a power outage in a smelter is that you stress the parts bringing back them -- bringing them back online. We lost a few parts, I think we probably lost close to a dozen parts bringing the plant back online from that power outage.So that was a setback. That really is out of the control, it impacted something like two-thirds of the country in Brazil. And so it was a setback for the plant. They've recovered. They have a daily action plan. It's a daily go, no-go on restarting parts and increasing amperage and as we said in the prepared remarks, we're at about 65% today.Alexander Hacking: Okay, that's super helpful. Thank you.Operator: The next question is from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.Timna Tanners: Yeah. Hey, good afternoon. I thought I would pivot a little bit, if I could, talking a little bit about some of your strategic initiatives and the cash flows, if I could. So first off, I just want to ask, I know you talked about advances in EcoLum and EcoSource, but can you elaborate a bit on the premium that you're garnering there?William Oplinger: The premiums are consistent with the premiums that you see quoted on various sources. So, it depends on the product, but the premiums are anywhere between $10 and $30 a ton.Timna Tanners: Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And then if we look at your cash balance, I know in the past you've said that you wanted to keep it at or below -- at or above a $1 billion and it kept below that. I know it's not a perfect number, but if we look at the cash resources and use year-to-date, if there's not a lot of free cash flow at these commodity prices even with the third quarter strong working capital release, and then we had from your Investor Day, you know, a great amount of initiatives that you're progressing on, I know you referred to them in the beginning as well like Australia refineries the future, et cetera, and I'm just wondering how do we reconcile again this commodity price environment, with some of those initiatives and some of the cash needs to source those. So the CapEx requirements going forward, are they compatible with this earnings environment or how are you thinking about that?Molly Beerman: Okay, thanks Timna. First of all, thanks for asking me a question. So let me just say on our cash position now, we're at $926 million. We still have access to significant liquidity. We have our undrawn revolving credit agreement, we have our auxiliary credit line. So those are available to us as needed. As you know we've taken action in the past working capital programs to monetize that we can take more aggressive actions on cost control and portfolio actions, but for us, if I look at kind of the short-term cash preservation, it really is focusing on our operations that are consuming more cash than generating. So that is the focus Bill mentioned earlier, we have key sites that we are working to improve. So that's the near-term on the cash management.On our CapEx, you can even see from this year, instead of adding to our CapEx project list, and filling the queue to spend the whole budget, we ended up staying just with the capital plans that were already on the agenda. As they slowed spending, which typically happens, we allow that just to happen, and so we've saved some money on CapEx. We can do that again with the programs that are in the next queue, and if you look out to our breakthrough technologies, each of those have to meet a certain criteria before they're going to receive funding, most of those now are pointing toward funding in 2025 and later. So we still have time for those and working through that financing and funding.Timna Tanners: Got it. So bluntly then if the commodity price stays at these levels, you know, no concerns in terms of proceeding with some of those initiatives ELYSIS Australia refinery of the future et cetera, but if we started to get into 2025, and didn't see much aluminum price improvement, then it might be needing to rethink some of those capital outlays. Is that a fair conclusion?Molly Beerman: Yes, that's fair, Timna.Timna Tanners: Okay, great. Thank you for the help.Operator: The next question is from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Carlos De Alba: Yes, thank you very much. Congratulations, Bill. Just on -- coming back -- coming back to Western Australia. So I just want to understand if you know what might be potentially the implications of the EPA deciding to do a formal assessment of your -- of your MMP's and mining plans. Would that result primarily on just a longer approval process, maybe more detailed analysis and requirements or will also result in higher costs, may be above our -- not beyond the 45 that you have, but that would prevent the 45 to completely come back to zero, once you are getting into the 2027 mining plan or those areas in 2027 with better bauxite quality.William Oplinger: So, Carlos, you can imagine we completely understand what the process is, at least from a legal and a tactical perspective going forward. I really hate to speculate on what -- what an assessment would look like, what an assessment would cover and until we had better insight into the EPA's decision-making process around what they would actually be assessing, it's really hard to answer that question. We're moving forward on the path to, you know, over the next 75 days to ensure that our permits get approved through the process and that's the focus. If we find ourselves in an assessment part of the process, we'll have to determine what is assessed and what the impact will be at that point and we'll let you know.Carlos De Alba: All right. Okay. And before I ask a question on smelting just a clarification, maybe Molly, I thought you were -- you had guided to around $55 million impact in the third quarter because of the bauxite issues, increasing from 45 in the second quarter. So you did better than that, right. Just to make sure that, that is based on the initiatives and the efforts you're doing to control these costs.Molly Beerman: Yeah, Carlos, it's actually three things. We did draw on stockpiles that had slightly better quality than we expected during the third quarter. We also see the refineries operating very well with the lower bauxite quality and then third, you're right, the mitigation efforts are just starting to drive down costs.Carlos De Alba: All right, thank you, Molly. And then finally, is there any update or any comments that you can provide on the situation of European smelters, I mean Lista remains with a third of the capacity shutdown. I don't know if there is any renegotiation or upcoming renegotiations of contracts for energy in Lista and Motion or the smelter in Ireland that is relevant given where prices are today.William Oplinger: So let's look at them independently, Motion is very well positioned and has a good energy source, is probably one of our most profitable plants in the system. So, Motion is in good shape. However, this new carbon legislation that is potential that could be -- could be passed into law in December, I think, we've noted the fact that we could have up to $24 million negative in the fourth quarter associated with Motion and Lista on based on that new carbon legislation. That type of a change in legislation makes it really difficult to make long-term decisions around investments in places like Norway. So, it's one of the disappointing things that I continue to see out of the Norwegian budgeting system that -- that it really, really makes it hard to determine that you're going to put a lot of capital into an environment where there is not a good structure around carbon or at least a predictable structure around carbon.In the case of Lista, Lista is slightly different, no plans at this point to potentially restart that idled capacity, Lista given its size, given its age, given its cost structure is under a lot of pressure, and so revert back to my comments from earlier in the presentation. Lista is an area that we're looking at, it's very similar to Kwinana, every opportunity to try to make that plant more competitive and we need to give some of the headwinds that's facing especially on the carbon side.Carlos De Alba: All right, great. And listen you have also a good contract there and no changes in the short term, right.William Oplinger: We have a long-term power contract in Iceland, there is a repricing mechanism that comes up later in the decade, but that's later I would say in the 2027 - 2028 timeframe.Carlos De Alba: Thank you very much, Bill.Operator: The next question is from Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Christopher LaFemina: Thanks. Hey, Bill. Congratulations on the new role and good luck.William Oplinger: Thank you.Christopher LaFemina: So just a question on the WA mining situation. So if the EPA does an assessment on the 2022 five-year plan, which is, I guess the one that you're operating under right now. Can you continue to mine, so I understand the point about lower grades until 2027 when you move up to Myara and Holyoake, but before that, is there a risk that they would -- they would basically not allow you to mine because reviewing the plan that you currently operating or do you -- do you have confidence that you'd be able to continue to mine under the existing plan.William Oplinger: Well, I think there are a variety of different outcomes that could occur if they go to a full assessment, but again as I answered to Carlos, let's see what gets assessed and we will react accordingly. We're confident that we are doing all the right things to avoid either having an assessment or not getting our mine permits approved. So, we're doing all the right things, we have line of sight to have an answer this quarter we believe and if we -- depending on that outcome we will take the right actions.Christopher LaFemina: And does the -- does the decision at the EPA makes as to whether they'll do an assessment, get impacted by the concessions that you're offering to make now or do they just base it on what the existing plan basically allows you to do?William Oplinger: You know, I don't know the answer to that one. So we would need to revert back to you. I'm not certain of that.Christopher LaFemina: Okay. All right. Thank you very much and good luck.William Oplinger: Thanks.Operator: Thanks. And our final question today is a follow-up from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.Lucas Pipes: Thank you very much, operator. Thank you very much for taking my follow-up question, Western Australia again that the $45 million order of magnitude what sort of savings could you be looking at, I think, you noted $10 million at Kwinana that would take it down to $43 million or so per quarter going forward. Order of magnitude, how much more could you be looking at? Thank you very much.Molly Beerman: Lucas, I don't have the -- I don't have a number. Again these are efforts that we're going to continue to work through. And as they are restructuring our programs that needs to be announced, we'll certainly do that. Otherwise, you'll simply see the additional savings work into our outlook as we progress through time. But I can tell you, we have dedicated teams on it. They're working very aggressively to identify savings, we've got a great pipeline of opportunities. So I do believe we will have meaningful mitigation to share. But I don't have a number for you today.Lucas Pipes: I appreciate that. Again, best of luck. Thank you.Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Oplinger for closing remarks.William Oplinger: Thanks for your questions, and interest in our company. As you can hear from my comments, it's a true honor to lead this company as we're positioned for long-term success. I really believe with disciplined focus and you've heard a lot of our talk around disciplined focus today, we will build an even stronger company for the future. I look forward to talking to many of you in the fourth quarter results in January and until then be safe.Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."", ""AAZacks Equity ResearchOctober 18, 2023 at 4:30 PM·3 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowAAWatchlistFor the quarter ended September 2023, Alcoa (AA) reported revenue of $2.6 billion, down 8.7% over the same period last year.

Shares of the company are down about 40% this year amid ongoing concerns of a global slowdown in consumption of the metal used in everything from kitchen appliances to automobiles.The news of Oplinger’s installment as CEO comes at a time when Alcoa has been struggling with operational and permitting setbacks in Australia for bauxite, a key feedstock for the refineries.The Kwinana plant was the first of Alcoa’s three Western Australia alumina refineries that’s been in operation for about 60 years, with the capacity to produce about 2.2 million metric tons of the raw material.Alcoa has “continued to make progress with relevant state government agencies in support of the annual mine approvals process for bauxite mining at the Huntly and Willowdale mines,” the company said.Third-Quarter EarningsHarvey, the former CEO, oversaw the transition of the more-than century-old American company after its late 2016 split from Arconic Corp., the name given to the value-added parts operations.Story continuesHarvey spent years shoring up the balance sheet, paying down debt and pension plan liabilities and making the commodity business more efficient. He oversaw the company’s headquarter change from New York City back to its original home of Pittsburgh, known for its iconic role as America’s steel city. The move underscored Harvey’s penchant for frugality.For the third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings before special items of $70 million, topping an estimate of $47.9 million.“We saw positive improvements in raw material and production costs, but lower average realized pricing for alumina and aluminum had the biggest impact on our results,” Oplinger said in the statement.The company’s alumina business segment accounts for some 28% of total revenue. The price of aluminum is down about 8% this year, headed for a second straight year of losses.(Adds shares in second paragraph.

""In the third quarter, we saw positive improvements in raw material and production costs, but lower average realized pricing for alumina and aluminum had the biggest impact on our results,"" he said. ""Moving forward, we are laser-focused on improvement, and we’re working across our global system to increase margins through operational productivity,"" Oplinger said.""We are already beginning to see progress with better, year-on-year safety results, as well as production records from our smelters in Quebec,"" Oplinger said. ""And we will build on that momentum across our business as we progress, to remain well positioned to deliver today and in the future.""Story continuesThird Quarter 2023 ResultsRevenue: The Company’s total third-party revenue of $2.60 billion decreased from $2.68 billion in the prior quarter with lower average realized third-party prices for alumina and aluminum. Alumina decreased 2 percent and aluminum fell 9 percent, although those lower prices were partially offset by higher shipments in both the Alumina and Aluminum segments.Shipments: In the Alumina segment, third-party shipments of alumina increased 11 percent sequentially, primarily due to increased trading and shipments across the worldwide refining system. In Aluminum, total shipments increased 1 percent sequentially.Production: Alumina production increased 10 percent sequentially to 2.8 million metric tons primarily due to higher production at the Alumar refinery in Brazil after the conclusion of elevated maintenance and higher output from Australian refineries that are adapting to lower grade bauxite.In Aluminum, Alcoa produced 532,000 metric tons, a sequential increase of 2 percent from the second quarter’s strong output, including multiple quarterly and year-to-date production records across the Canadian smelters.Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation was $168 million, or $0.94 per share. Sequentially, the results reflect lower alumina and aluminum prices and unfavorable currency impacts of $83 million, which were not offset by the benefits of lower raw material and production costs in both the Alumina and Aluminum segments. Additionally, the third quarter results include the benefit of a $58 million valuation allowance reversal on the deferred tax assets of the Company’s subsidiaries in Iceland.Adjusted net loss was $202 million, or $1.14 per share, excluding the impact from special items of $34 million of income. Notable special items include $58 million in a net benefit for discrete tax items primarily related to the reversal of the tax valuation allowance described above, partially offset by a mark-to-market loss of $21 million related to energy contracts.Adjusted EBITDA excluding special items was $70 million, a $67 million sequential decrease primarily due to lower prices for aluminum and alumina, partially offset by lower raw material and production costs.Cash: Alcoa ended the quarter with a cash balance of $926 million. Cash provided from operations was $69 million. Cash provided from financing activities was $35 million, primarily related to $40 million of net contributions from noncontrolling interest and $32 million of net short-term borrowings, partially offset by $18 million of cash dividends on common stock. Cash used for investing activities was $166 million, primarily related to capital expenditures of $145 million. Free cash flow was negative $76 million.Working capital: For the third quarter, Receivables from customers of $0.7 billion, Inventories of $2.2 billion and Accounts payable, trade of $1.5 billion comprised DWC working capital. The Company reported 50 days working capital, a sequential improvement of five days. Inventory days improved by four days primarily due to lower raw material costs.Key Strategic Actions:Western Australia Mine Plan Approvals: During the third quarter of 2023, the Company continued to make progress with relevant state government agencies in support of the annual mine approvals process for bauxite mining at the Huntly and Willowdale mines. The Company submitted a revised Mine Management Program (MMP) for the period 2023-2027 with enhancements meant to address stakeholder needs and expectations.The submission to regulators includes additional controls for the protection of drinking water, including distances from reservoirs, and biodiversity that includes a plan to accelerate rehabilitation. The Company is working toward an MMP approval during the fourth quarter of 2023.Separately, following a public comment period that concluded in August, the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority (WA EPA) continues to consider a third-party request on whether to formally assess all or part of the current and next MMPs and, if so, at what level. The WA EPA has indicated it expects to make a decision before the end of the year.The Company supports moving toward a modernized approvals framework for new major mine regions. In June 2020, Alcoa proactively requested an assessment by the WA EPA on two new mine regions (Myara North and Holyoake) for the Huntly mine.The Company expects the bauxite quality at Myara North and Holyoake to be more consistent with the historic higher quality at the existing Myara Central. Alcoa continues to work to secure approvals for these new regions, and anticipates mining in the new regions no earlier than 2027. Until then, the Company expects bauxite quality similar to recent grades.During the third quarter, the Company continued to pursue cost reduction measures and initiated productivity programs across its operations in Australia to mitigate the financial impacts of lower bauxite grade and to optimize current operating levels. As a first action under these programs, Alcoa initiated a restructuring program at the Kwinana refinery and incurred a $6 million charge in the third quarter of 2023 for employee severance costs to be paid through the first quarter of 2024. The Company anticipates approximately $10 million in annual savings from this action.Energy Contract: In August 2023, Alcoa announced a new power agreement with AGL Energy Limited (AGL) to support future operations at Portland Aluminium Smelter in the State of Victoria in Australia. The nine-year agreement for 300 megawatts of power supply is effective July 1, 2026, when current contracts with AGL end. This volume represents approximately 50 percent of the energy required to meet the facility’s total capacity of 358,000 mtpy.Commercial: The Company sold its first non-metallurgical variety of EcoSource™ low-carbon alumina, which is now marketed in both non-metallurgical and smelter grades. Also, Alcoa has grown sales of EcoLum™ low-carbon aluminum, which has realized more than a 60 percent increase in year-over-year sales, including new purchases in North America. Both EcoSource and EcoLum are part of Alcoa’s Sustana™ family of products.Sustainability: As a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), Alcoa is committed to the Global International Standard for Tailings Management (GISTM). Alcoa disclosed before an August 2023 deadline its progress for applicable facilities, in accordance with the ICMM Conformance Protocol.2023 OutlookThe following outlook does not include reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, including transformation, intersegment eliminations and other corporate Adjusted EBITDA; operational tax expense; and other expense; each excluding special items, to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because it is impractical to forecast certain special items, such as restructuring charges and mark-to-market contracts without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity associated with predicting the occurrence and financial impact of such special items. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.The Company expects the outlook for 2023 total alumina and aluminum shipments to remain unchanged between 12.7 and 12.9 million metric tons, and between 2.5 and 2.6 million metric tons, respectively.Within fourth quarter 2023 Alumina Segment Adjusted EBITDA, the Company expects a $50 million benefit from lower raw material prices, lower production costs and higher volumes, partially offset by $10 million in higher energy costs. Additionally, the Company expects impacts related to lower bauxite grade in Australia to be consistent with the third quarter of 2023.Within fourth quarter 2023 Aluminum Segment Adjusted EBITDA, the Company expects $35 million in lower raw material prices to be fully offset by unfavorable value add aluminum products sales and higher production costs. Alumina costs in the Aluminum segment are expected to be favorable by $5 million sequentially.Additionally, the Company expects unfavorable energy impacts of approximately $30 million mainly due to the carbon dioxide compensation changes in Norway. The Norwegian government recently proposed a budget that sets a floor for the carbon dioxide compensation scheme to be paid in 2024 based on 2023 power purchased. Upon approval, the Company expects to record an adjustment of approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter to reverse amounts accrued in cost of goods sold for 2023 credits earned through September 30, 2023. The total impact of this budget proposal on the Company’s full year results would be approximately $25 million.Other expense for the third quarter 2023 included negative impacts of $35 million, primarily related to foreign currency losses that may not recur.Based on current alumina and aluminum market conditions, Alcoa expects fourth quarter operational tax expense to approximate $10 million to $20 million, which may vary with market conditions and jurisdictional profitability.Conference CallAlcoa will hold its quarterly conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on Wednesday, October 18, 2023, to present third quarter 2023 financial results and discuss the business, developments, and market conditions.The call will be webcast via the Company’s homepage on www.alcoa.com.

Management believes these measures are meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of Alcoa Corporation excluding the impacts of restructuring and other charges, various tax items, and other special items (collectively, ""special items""). There can be no assurances that additional special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes it is appropriate to consider Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation and Diluted EPS determined under GAAP as well as Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation – as adjusted and Diluted EPS – as adjusted.(1)Other special items include the following:for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, a net unfavorable change in mark-to-market energy derivative instruments ($21), gain on sale of non-core rights ($9), and charges for other special items ($1);for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, a net unfavorable change in mark-to-market energy derivative instruments ($22) and costs related to the restart process at the Alumar, Brazil smelter ($13); and,for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, a net unfavorable change in mark-to-market energy derivative instruments ($49), costs related to the restart process at the Alumar, Brazil smelter ($14), costs related to the restart process of the Portland, Australia smelter ($6), and charges for other special items ($3).(2)Discrete and other tax items are generally unusual or infrequently occurring items, changes in law, items associated with uncertain tax positions, or the effect of measurement-period adjustments and include the following:for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, a benefit related to the reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of the Company\'s subsidiaries in Iceland ($58) and a net benefit for other discrete tax items ($2);for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, net charge for discrete tax items ($1); and,for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, net benefit for discrete tax items ($1).(3)The tax impact on special items is based on the applicable statutory rates in the jurisdictions where the special items occurred. The noncontrolling interest impact on special items represents Alcoa’s partner’s share of certain special items.(4)In any period with a Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation (GAAP or as adjusted), the average number of shares applicable to diluted earnings per share exclude certain share equivalents as their effect is anti-dilutive.Alcoa Corporation and subsidiariesCalculation of Financial Measures (unaudited), continued(in millions)Adjusted EBITDAQuarter endedSeptember 30,2023June 30,2023September 30,2022Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation$(168)$(102)$(746)Add:Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest(25)(19)(23)(Benefit from) provision for income taxes(35)2240Other expenses, net85635Interest expense262725Restructuring and other charges, net2224652Provision for depreciation, depletion, and amortization163153149Adjusted EBITDA68111132Special items(1)22678Adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items$70$137$210Alcoa Corporation’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation, depletion, and amortization. Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation, depletion, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure is meaningful to investors because Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information with respect to Alcoa Corporation’s operating performance and the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations. The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.(1)Special items include the following (see reconciliation of Adjusted Income above for additional information):for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, costs related to the restart process at the Alumar, Brazil smelter ($1) and costs related to the restart process at the San Ciprián, Spain smelter ($1);for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, costs related to the restart process at the Alumar, Brazil smelter ($13). Additionally, due to changes in price in the Australian power market, the mark-to-market contracts associated with the Portland smelter have generated gains ($13) in Other expenses, net which economically offset a portion of the cost of power recorded in Cost of goods sold. This non-GAAP reclass presents the net cost of power within Cost of goods sold; and,for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, net cost of power associated with the Portland smelter ($57), costs related to the restart process at the Alumar, Brazil smelter ($14), costs related to the restart process of the Portland, Australia smelter ($6), and charges for other special items ($1).Alcoa Corporation and subsidiariesCalculation of Financial Measures (unaudited), continued(in millions)Free Cash FlowQuarter endedSeptember 30,2023June 30,2023September 30,2022Cash provided from (used for) operations$69$(13)$134Capital expenditures(145)(115)(128)Free cash flow$(76)$(128)$6Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures, which are necessary to maintain and expand Alcoa Corporation’s asset base and are expected to generate future cash flows from operations. It is important to note that Free Cash Flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements, are not deducted from the measure.Net DebtSeptember 30,2023December 31,2022Short-term borrowings$42$—Long-term debt due within one year11Long-term debt, less amount due within one year1,8091,806Total debt1,8521,807Less: Cash and cash equivalents9261,363Net debt$926$444Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Commercial airframe product sales in the segment more than doubled compared to the prior year, as the aerospace ramp continues.""Operating Results by Segment High Performance Materials & Components (HPMC)($ millions)Q3 2023Q2 2023Q3 2022Sales$539.5$527.1$457.6Segment EBITDA$115.7$108.1$85.8% of Sales21.5\xa0%20.5\xa0%18.8\xa0%\xa0HPMC\'s third quarter 2023 sales increased $12 million, or 2%, compared to the second quarter 2023, primarily driven by growth in the commercial airframe market. \xa0Overall aerospace and defense sales were 85% of total HPMC sales in the third quarter 2023. \xa0Third quarter 2023 sales improved 18% compared to the third quarter 2022, with total aerospace and defense related sales increasing 22% compared to the prior year period. HPMC segment EBITDA was $115.7 million, or 21.5% of sales. Increased volumes on higher-margin next-generation commercial aerospace platforms continue to drive strong incremental margins.Advanced Alloys & Solutions (AA&S)($ millions)Q3 2023Q2 2023Q3 2022Sales$486.1$518.9$574.4Segment EBITDA$50.4$63.2$75.8% of Sales10.4\xa0%12.2\xa0%13.2\xa0%\xa0AA&S third quarter 2023 sales decreased by $33 million and $88 million compared to the second quarter 2023 and third quarter 2022, respectively. \xa0Lower sales are primarily due to recessionary softness in general industrial end markets, as well as planned outages. \xa0Partially offsetting, sales of commercial aerospace products increased by 7% compared to the prior year period.AA&S segment EBITDA was $50.4 million, or 10.4% of sales.\xa0 Increases in titanium mill products deliveries were offset by reduced deliveries of nickel-based alloys and precision rolled strip products in the third quarter 2023.\xa0 Third quarter 2023 results reflect the previously communicated seasonal outages.\xa0 Year-over-year EBITDA was negatively impacted by increased pension expense in 2023.Corporate Items and CashRestructuring and other charges:Third quarter 2023: $4.2 million includes pre-tax charges of $2.8 million for start-up costs and $1.9 million of costs associated with an unplanned outage at our Lockport, NY melt facility, partially offset by $0.5 million of restructuring credits.Second quarter 2023: $9.2 million includes pre-tax charges of $4.5 million for start-up costs, $2.7 million of severance-related restructuring charges, and $2.8 million primarily for asset write-offs related to the closure of our Robinson, PA operation, of which $0.8 million was accelerated depreciation on fixed assets.Third quarter 2022: $17.3 million includes a pre-tax charge of $19.9 million in connection with the settlement of litigation related to the 2016 indefinite idling of the Rowley, UT titanium sponge production facility, partially offset by restructuring credits of $2.6 million related to the reversals of previously recognized reserves, due to lower than expected severance-related costs.Corporate expenses in the third quarter 2023 were $12.9 million, compared to $18.1 million in the second quarter 2023, and $14.2 million in the prior year quarter. Third quarter 2023 corporate expenses, compared to the second quarter 2023, decreased in part due to lower incentive compensation.Closed operations and other expense was $5.1 million in the third quarter 2023, compared to $3.4 million in the second quarter 2023, and $6.3 million in the prior year quarter. Higher costs in the third quarter 2023, compared to the second quarter 2023, were associated with reduced foreign currency gains.Third quarter 2023 results include a $4.9 million income tax provision, compared to $3.7 million in the second quarter 2023, and $3.0 million in the prior year quarter. Tax expense in all periods is mainly attributable to the Company\'s foreign operations. ATI maintains a valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets and does not expect to pay any significant U.S. federal or state income taxes until 2025 due to net operating loss carryforwards.For the third quarter of 2023, cash used in operating activities was $114.2 million, and cash used in operating activities was $331.3 million on a year-to-date basis. The cash used in operating activities includes voluntary pension contributions of $222 million in the third quarter and $272 million on a year-to-date basis. Reduced accounts receivable and inventory levels were partially offset by lower accounts payable in the third quarter. Third quarter 2023 managed working capital as a percent of sales was 39.9%. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2023 were $147.3 million.Cash on hand at September 30, 2023 was $433 million, and available additional liquidity under the asset-based lending (ABL) credit facility was approximately $550 million. As of September 30, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings on the ABL credit facility. ATI has no significant debt maturities until 2025.In August 2023, the company issued $425 million of 7.25% senior unsecured notes due in 2030, and used a portion of the proceeds, $222 million, to fund the qualified defined benefit pension plan as part of our long-term pension derisking strategy.In the third quarter 2023, the company repurchased $45 million of common stock at an average price of $43.93, retiring approximately 1.0 million shares. As of September 30, 2023, total share repurchase authorization available was $30 million.In October 2023, the company purchased group annuity contracts to transfer approximately 85% of the defined benefit pension obligations and related assets to an insurance company for approximately 8,200 plan participants. This transaction had no impact on the amount, timing or form of the retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries.Outlook""We continue to drive increased margins to generate cash and deploy it effectively. As new long-term agreements accelerate, we are working proactively with our customers to meet their production needs,"" said Wetherbee. ""We expect sequential and year-over-year ATI earnings growth in the fourth quarter, led by our HPMC segment.""HPMC EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter are expected to continue to improve year-over-year, in line with our prior guidance. Backlogs remain strong across aerospace and defense.\xa0 We continue to optimize operations and resolve bottlenecks that come with growing demand.\xa0 Continued process optimization will favorably impact future growth and performance.In the AA&S segment, the Company assumes stable performance in the fourth quarter 2023, due to sustained growth in the aerospace and defense related markets.\xa0 These benefits will help offset certain recessionary forces impacting this segment.The Company expects to generate significant cash from operations in the fourth quarter primarily due to improvements in managed working capital as we make progress on our ongoing strategic growth projects.***********ATI will conduct a conference call with investors and analysts on Thursday, November\xa02, 2023, at 10:30 a.m. ET to discuss the financial results.

Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"").\xa0 However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods.\xa0 For example, we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors because these measures are commonly used to analyze companies on the basis of operating performance, leverage and liquidity.\xa0 Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts to evaluate operating performance.\xa0 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management\'s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and capital expenditures.\xa0 Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company\'s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\xa0 The following table provides the calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures

Additionally, Eastman is ramping up three molecular recycling plants over the next few years based on its Polyester Renewal Technology, a less energy intensive and lower cost production process.

(NASDAQ:ALGN), a global medical device company best known for its “Invisalign” clear aligners, having created the clear aligner category in 1999. Since that time, it has been a disruptor of the traditional use of wire and bracket braces to straighten teeth and treat malocclusions. While it is leader in the clear aligner category with roughly 85-90% market share, the bigger competition is taking share from wire and brackets and on that measure, it only has 10-15% share of the overall teeth straightening market. Over time, through innovation and vertical integration, the company has evolved to be able to treat over 90% of all cases. Further, it has done a great job deepening relationships with orthodontists and general practitioner dentists over time. All in all, we believe this is a business with a durable competitive advantage, operating in a large, growing and very attractive industry, led by a proven and long-term oriented management team, with a very long runway ahead of it to grow and compound at very attractive rates.”9.

(NYSE:DD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We recently increased our investment in DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD), a specialty chemical company run by legendary value creator Ed Breen, who is leading a corporate transformation. In November, DuPont divested its most cyclical and lowest margin business segment, Mobility & Materials, to Celanese for $11 billion, or 14x 2023e EV/EBITDA. Following the divestiture, the improved DuPont trades at 11x 2023e EV/EBITDA, which represents a ~30% discount to its peer group.We believe the company is laser-focused on closing this gap. First, $5 billion of the proceeds are being deployed to repurchase nearly 15% of its outstanding shares. The next significant catalyst for the stock is a potential settlement of PFAS-related multidistrict litigation in South Carolina, which remains an overhang on the stock even though DuPont’s PFAS liability was largely ring-fenced by the 2021 settlement with Chemours and Corteva. DuPont’s strong management team is eager to demonstrate the business quality of the new portfolio during the current period of economic volatility. We expect the combined catalysts of increased share repurchases, the pending resolution of legal claims, and the new business structure to drive meaningful value for shareholders.”7. PTC Inc.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of steel and specialty metals is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.02 billion, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.92% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Allegheny Technologies?For Allegheny Technologies, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.72%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Allegheny Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Allegheny Technologies would post earnings of $0.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.59, delivering a surprise of +7.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Allegheny Technologies doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of ATI Inc. (NYSE:ATI).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for ATI How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ATI is:23% = US$297m ÷ US$1.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.23.Does ATI Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, ATI has a better ROE than the average (12%) in the Metals and Mining industry.That is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesATI's Debt And Its 23% ROEATI does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.30. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

In this dynamic world, three companies are emerging as strategic pioneers. Each is carving a unique path toward sustained growth and profitability. These companies are not merely stocks in a portfolio; they represent the vanguard of rapid innovation and adaptability. They represent growth stocks to buy.The article delves deep into the strategic blueprints of these market leaders. The first one’s stronghold in aerospace and defense, the second’s calculated bet on China’s semiconductor expansion, and the third one’s diversification and technological innovation—these strategic growth stocks to buy may turn a $10,000 investment into a potential $1 million windfall.Let’s dive in and explore more about their ability to achieve long-term growth in a world where adaptability and vision are the ultimate currencies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGrowth Stocks to Buy: ATI (ATI)MMAT stock: An array of glowing lights.Source: BLAGORODEZ / Shutterstock.comThe American producer of specialty materials ATI (NYSE:ATI)\xa0may benefit fundamentally from several key factors. It includes its strong position in the aerospace and defense (A&D) markets, strategic transformation initiatives and financial performance. To begin with, ATI has a robust presence in the aerospace and defense sectors, which have been consistently performing well. A&D sales have been upward, growing\xa05% QoQ\xa0and a remarkable 39% YoY. The defense sector specifically has shown significant growth. In this context, sales surpassed $100 million in Q2 2023, representing a 7% QoQ and a 25% YoY increase.One of ATI’s key growth areas is its involvement in advancing hypersonic technologies, which is experiencing accelerating demand. The company’s order backlog has surged by more than 20% YTD, reaching $3.5 billion by the end of June. This strong demand in A&D markets, including materials for military ground vehicles, rotorcraft and naval applications positions ATI for substantial long-term growth.Story continuesMoreover, ATI’s percentage of overall revenue attributed to A&D has increased from 46% to\xa058%\xa0in just one year, signaling rapid progress toward its goal of 65% A&D sales. This robust presence in A&D markets is a fundamental driver of the company’s long-term success.Finally, ATI’s strategic transformation has been yielding significant benefits. In this direction, the HPMC segment has been a standout performer, with sales growing by 12% QoQ and an impressive 33% YoY. This growth has been driven by increasing commercial aerospace production and strong demand in the defense sector. Finally, the strategic expansion of HPMC and its focus on maintaining solid margins may lead to massive changes in its market valuation.ACM Research (ACMR)a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a websiteSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOne strategic move that positions\xa0ACM Research\xa0(NASDAQ:ACMR)\xa0for long-term value growth is its foresight regarding the shift in China’s semiconductor\xa0manufacturing strategy. The company predicted China would accelerate its capacity expansion in mature nodes despite initial concerns about US-China trade restrictions. This prediction has materialized as China seeks to bridge the substantial gap between its mature nodes’ capacity and market consumption.ACM Research’s focus on serving this growing market segment is a shrewd decision. By targeting mature nodes in China, the company is tapping into a sector still in the early stages of its expansion. As China intensifies its efforts to boost its domestic semiconductor capabilities, ACM Research is poised to benefit significantly. Based on its differentiated technology and diverse multi-product portfolio, the company has a competitive advantage in catering to this burgeoning market.Further, ACM Research’s reported growth in its advanced packaging segment is significant. Excluding specific categories, this segment witnessed\xa014% YoY\xa0growth in Q2 2023 and a remarkable 58% growth YTDFundamentally, advanced packaging, which includes innovations like 2.5D and 3D packaging, plays a pivotal role. It is driving higher performance for applications such as AI and advanced language models like GPT.Notably, ACM Research’s robust product offerings in advanced packaging tools, including coater, developer, scrubber, PR stripper, and wet etcher, position it as a key player in this growth segment.Finally, The company’s unique advantage lies in being the sole provider of a full set of wet and advanced plating tools, solidifying its position in this critical market. If you’re looking for good growth stocks, start here.\xa0Perion Network (PERI)peri stock: the Perion logo on the side of a buildingSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comPerion Network (NASDAQ:PERI) has multiple value growth drivers based on a strategic diversification business model. The approach enables the company to adapt swiftly to shifting advertising budgets while maintaining robust profit margins. For instance, its revenue surged by an impressive\xa022%\xa0YoY (in Q2 2023), with an astounding 45% YoY increase in margins.By participating in various segments of the industry, including search advertising, video, CTV, retail media and digital advertising as a whole, Perion mitigates risks associated with market fluctuations.On the other hand, Perion’s retail media business is a stellar example of its innovation and data-driven approach. This segment has grown exponentially, boasting a staggering 63% YoY increase.What drives this growth is a sophisticated platform that enables large retailers to leverage their data for enhanced sales, customer loyalty, and return on investment (ROI). Specifically, Perion is transforming traditional advertising by replacing outdated circulars with precise digital targeting.In detail, its fundamental value growth lies in\xa0three layers of data: anonymized retail data, third-party enrichment data (demographics, behavior, location, etc.), and their proprietary iHUB data. Technically, these data layers feed into an AI decision-making engine, generating thousands of dynamic creatives. The innovative approach allows Perion to deliver highly relevant, personalized, and localized ad experiences. This is easily one of the top growth stocks on the market.\xa0On the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Brent Vandermause, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Brent Vandermause: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and our strategy. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2022 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom.Tom Wilson: Good morning. We appreciate your investment in time in Allstate. Let's start with an overview of results and then Mario and Jess will walk through our operating performance. Let's begin on Slide 2. So our strategy's 2 components: increase personal Property-Liability market share. And expand protection provided to customers which are shown in the 2 over on the left. On the right-hand side, you can see the highlights for the quarter. We made good progress on improving auto insurance profitability. There is more to be done but you can see the improving trend again this quarter. We decided to pursue our sale of Allstate's Health and Benefits businesses. After successful integration of Allstate's voluntary benefits business, with National General's group and individual health businesses, we've created a really well-positioned benefits platform and that strategy was part of the National General acquisition plan.Story continuesOur success now positions us to achieve additional growth that potential could be maximized by aligning this platform with a broader set of complementary products, distribution channels and capabilities. We anticipate completing a transaction in 2024. We also made progress in executing and transformative growth initiatives to set the stage for personal profit liability market share growth as margins improve. The second part of our strategy to broaden protection offerings also progressed with Allstate Protection Plans growth. Let's review the financial results on Slide 3. Revenues of $14.5 billion in the third quarter increased 9.8% above the prior year at $1.3 billion. The increase was driven by higher property liability earned premiums in auto and homeowners insurance, primarily reflecting the 2022 and 2023 rate increases.Which has resulted in Property-Liability earned premium growth of 10%. Net investment income of $689 million reflects proactive portfolio actions, including extending fixed income duration and lowering public equity holdings to take advantage of higher fixed income yields. Net loss of $41 million and adjusted net income of $214 million that's $0.81 per diluted share reflects improved profit liability underwriting performance. Property-Liability recorded an underwriting loss of $414 million which compares to $1.3 billion loss in the third quarter of 2022. While the improvement was encouraging, loss cost trends remain elevated and require continued execution of auto insurance profit improvement plan, particularly in California, New York and New Jersey.Slide 4 provides an update on the execution of the 4 components of that plan. Starting with rates; the Allstate brand has implemented 26.4% of rates since 2022, including 9.5% through the first 3 quarters of 2023. National General implemented rate increases of 10% in 2022 and an additional 8.8% through the first 9 months in 2023. We will continue to pursue rate increases to restore auto insurance margins back to target levels. Second, reducing operating expenses is core to both the profit improvement plan. And importantly, the transformative growth plan to become a low-cost provider of protection. Expenses are down and we have a path to further reductions. Third, we've restricted new business growth in areas and classes of business where we are not achieving target returns.Given the success we've had in some areas, we're selectively removing these restrictions in some states and segments; fourth, enhancing claim practices in a high inflationary and increasingly litigious environment are required to deliver customer value. That includes accelerating the settlement of injury claims and increasing in-person inspections. Turning to Slide 5. Let's touch base on why we believe this profit improvement will work in the current competitive environment. Allstate's capabilities and business model have generated industry-leading auto insurance margins over the last 10 years with an average combined ratio of roughly 96.5% and an average underwriting income of $800 million. That represents approximately a 5-point outperformance in the industry which generates an incremental profit of about $1.3 billion annually.Only a few of the other top 10 insurance companies have a similar record. In the current competitive environment, these same capabilities will enable us to continue the progress made in improving auto insurance margins. The rapid rise in auto claim severities eroded profits for the industry with most carriers responding by increasing auto insurance prices and lowering expenses. Allstate Progressive and GEICO has significantly raised auto insurance prices since 2019. State Farms increased its prices to a lesser degree but as a result, appears to be incurring large underwriting losses. Expense reductions are also being pursued by many companies, including lowering advertising spending which has moderated competition for new customers. The impact on policies in force is dependent on each company's individual profit and growth plan.As Mario will discuss, the Allstate brand policies in force has declined, particularly in 4 large states. GEICO's policies in force have declined by a larger amount, while Progressive has grown. Allstate's capabilities will enable achievement of the profit improvement plan in its competitive environment. Now let's review the potential sale of the Health and Benefits business on Slide 6. We acquired National General was primarily to improve our position in independent agent channel for Property-Liability insurance and we've exceeded our goals in that integration. The acquisition also gave us the opportunity to combine Allstate's voluntary benefits business with National General's group and individual health businesses. Successfully combining these into 1 business unit has created a strong benefits platform with substantial additional value can be realized by aligning with a broader set of product offerings, distribution and capabilities such as medical network management.Allstate Health and Benefits separates 3 successful businesses which is shown in the middle there and the $1 trillion employer benefit markets group and individual health when you add those all up. We've been the preeminent voluntary benefits provided for 24 years. With a comprehensive product offering that generates annualized premiums and contract charges of $1 billion and $300 million of new sales. National General's group health business targets the small case size market. And has $700 million of premium in fee revenue. And $400 million in new sales. The individual health protection is provided through both proprietary and third-party products which generates both underwriting and fee income. The Health and Benefits businesses have revenues of $2.3 billion which is 4% of total corporate revenues and adjusted net income of $240 million for the trailing 12 months which you can see in the 2 pie charts in the bottom and it's kind of spread between all the businesses.The employer voluntary benefits and group health businesses when you add them up, have roughly 48,000 relationships ranging from Fortune 50 companies to small businesses and over $4.3 million policies in force. The growth potential of these businesses can be accelerated with greater alignment with a wide range of companies in the market that are shown on the right-hand side. With its attractive business profile and financial results, we expect the transaction to be completed in 2024. In addition to improving profitability and strategically allocating capital, we continue to implement the transformative growth initiative to position the Property-Liability market share gains as margins improve. The fine components initiative was shown as top of Slide 7.Affordable simple connected protection is at the heart of the strategy to further improve customer value. Customers will have access to high-quality protection that better meets your needs at a low cost with hassle-free experiences. However, they choose to access our broad distribution network. We're live in the market with a new business experience and further enhance the connectivity of the Allstate at this week. Mario will discuss our success in expanding customer access. While each transformative growth element is at various stages of maturity. We're moving from Phase III of building new model towards scaling it in Phase IV. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario to go through the Property-Liability results.Mario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom. Let's start on Slide 8. Our comprehensive auto profit improvement plan is improving margins. Property-Liability earned premium increased 10% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher average premiums which were partially offset by a decline in policies in force. The underwriting loss of $414 million in the quarter improved $878 million compared to the prior year quarter due to the improvement in our auto loss ratio. The chart on the right highlights the components of the 103.4 [ph] combined ratio in the quarter which improved 8.2 points despite a 2.8 point increase in the catastrophe loss ratio compared to prior year. Prior year reserve estimates, excluding catastrophes, were $166 million unfavorable or at 1.4 point [ph] adverse impact on the combined ratio in the quarter.$82 million was attributable to the runoff property liability annual reserve review. And $84 million in Allstate Protection primarily driven by national general personal auto injury coverages. The underlying combined ratio of 91.9 improved by 4.5 points compared to the prior year quarter and 1 point sequentially versus the second quarter of 2023 despite continued elevated severity inflation. Now let's move to Slide 9 to review Allstate's auto insurance profit trends. The third quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 102.1 was 15.3 points [ph] favorable to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher earned premium, lower adverse prior year reserve reestimates and expense efficiencies. As a reminder, we continuously assess claim severities as the year progresses.For example, last year, as 2022 developed, we increased current report year ultimate severity expectations which influenced the quarterly reported trends. While loss cost trends remain historically elevated, the pace of increase moderated in the third quarter. As Allstate brand weighted average major coverage severity improved to 9% compared to the 11% estimate as of the end of last quarter. The chart on the left shows the sequential improvement in quarterly underlying combined ratios from 2022 through the current quarter with quarterly reported figures adjusted to the full year severity level for 2022 and 2023 adjusted for current severity estimates as of the third quarter. Higher average premium and the continued execution of our profit improvement plan drove the sequential improvement in underlying combined ratio to 98.8 as reported or a 100.5 in the bar graph when removing the 1.7 point [ph] favorable impact on the third quarter from improved severity for claims reported in the first 2 quarters of the year.A financial advisor giving advice to a couple, illustrating the personal finance and insurance products the company offers.The chart on the right portrays how our comprehensive actions are resulting in a higher proportion of the portfolio progressing towards or achieving target levels of profitability. Excluding the 3 large states which generated 45% of Allstate brand auto underwriting loss in 2022, Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 97.2. The Premiums from states with an underlying combined ratio below 100 improved to 59% of the portfolio in the third quarter, doubling from the percentage at year-end 2022 and up almost 10 points from 50% in the second quarter. Slide 10 shows the impact on policies in force from actions to improve profitability. Allstate brand rate increases have exceeded 26% over the last 7 quarters. New issued applications shown in the middle chart, declined 19.5% compared to the prior year quarter, largely driven by actions to reduce growth in unprofitable states.California, New York and New Jersey combined declined 75% compared to the prior year. Allstate brand auto policies in force decreased by 6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year, partially driven by the lower new business and also driven by lower retention due to rate increases. Elevated loss trends in Texas required implementation of rate increases of over 50% in the last 21 months. As a result, retention has declined, while profitability has improved. Policies in force in these 4 large states combined decreased by 8.7%, whereas the remaining states declined by 4.7% compared to the prior year through the third quarter. On Slide 11, we take a deeper look at the National General Auto book. While third quarter margins were impacted by $95 million of unfavorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve reestimates primarily across liability coverages.The underlying combined ratio of 96.8 in the quarter and 95.7 year-to-date remains largely consistent with the prior year periods. Reflecting higher loss cost expectations given the reserve strengthening to date, offset by higher average premiums and expense efficiencies. The National General business as product, including fee-based revenue features and claims capabilities to accept in the nonstandard auto insurance market. As you can see in the chart on the right, 75% of the written premium growth in the third quarter of 2023 is coming from nonstandard auto which is more profitable than the overall national general auto insurance business. Our new middle-market product, Custom 360, is now available in nearly 1/3 of the U.S. market and is also contributing to growth.While the legacy National General and Encompass businesses which will be run off as we implement custom 360, are having the lowest impact on growth. Slide 12 covers homeowners insurance results which incurred an underwriting loss in Q3, driven by higher catastrophe losses. On the left, you can see net written premium increased 12.1% from the prior year quarter. primarily driven by higher average gross written premium per policy in both the Allstate and National General brands and a 0.8% increase in policies in force. Allstate Brand average gross written premium per policy increased by 13.2% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by implemented rate increases throughout 2022 and an additional 9.5 points implemented through the first 9 months of 2023.As well as inflation and insurance home replacement costs. The underlying combined ratio of 72.9 improved by 1.2 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned premium, lower frequency and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by higher severity. We remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in the homeowners business. Slide 13 highlights progress on expanding customer access as part of transformative growth. We continue to enhance capabilities across distribution channels and are the only major carrier with competitive offerings and branded agent, independent agent and direct distribution. The exclusive agent channel represents the majority of Allstate's U.S. personal lines premium at approximately $32 billion or roughly 22% market share in this channel.Our exclusive agents continue to be a strength, offering personalized local advice customers value in this $145 billion market. While exclusive agent auto new business decreased by 5% overall, applications per agency, excluding California, New York and New Jersey has increased by 13.4% so far this year. In addition, modifications to compensation have driven bundling at point of sale to an all-time high of over 75%. Agent performance continues to improve as they adapt to new compensation programs. We also have great growth potential through independent agents. The acquisition of National General strategically positioned Allstate to grow in the independent agent channel. National General continues to profitably grow nonstandard auto, while converting legacy Encompass and Allstate independent agent business onto their platform.Expanded nonstandard auto presence in 12 states represented 9% of National General's 12.9% increase in policies in force during 2023. As we leverage Allstate's expertise in standard auto and homeowners, this channel should represent another source of profitable growth. The direct channel had a significant decline in new business volume this year since this was the most effective place to reduce new business volume and was the most impacted by the reduction in advertising. We have improved our capabilities in this channel, so it will be another source of growth moving forward. And now, I'll hand it over to Jess to discuss the remainder of our results.Jesse Merten: All right. Thank you, Mario. I'll start on Slide 14 to discuss investment results. We proactively repositioned our investment portfolio based on continuous monitoring of changes in the economic environment, current market conditions and enterprise risk and return considerations. As shown in the chart on the left, net investment income totaled $689 million in the quarter, relatively flat to the third quarter of last year but with a higher contribution from the market-based portfolio. Market-based income of $567 million shown in blue, was $165 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting repositioning of the fixed income portfolio into longer duration bonds, a reduction of public equity holdings and higher interest rates.The chart on the right shows changes we made to the duration of the bond portfolio in comparison to interest rates. In 2021, we began reducing duration to reflect the belief that interest rates would rise. This not only reduced some losses as rates increased but it provided flexibility to reposition as yields increased. Starting in the middle of last year, we began increasing duration as rates increased which has increased market-based income. On Slide 15, let's take a closer look at our performance-based portfolio which offers diversification and enhances longer-term returns. The portfolio is anchored in private equity and real estate is diversified across infrastructure, energy, agriculture and timber investments. We hold more than 400 names, including funds with multiple underlying positions across diversified vintage years.These investments are focused on long-term value creation and we expect quarter-to-quarter income volatility as seen in the bars on the chart to the left, where quarterly returns have ranged from a negative 2.3% and to positive 8.6% over the last 5 years. The benefit from accepting this volatility is shown on the right with 3- and 5-year annualized returns of 19% and 12%. The private equity portion of the portfolio has outperformed public equity benchmarks over 3, 5 and 10 years. Slide 16 covers the results of our Protection Services businesses. Revenues in these businesses increased 8.9% to $697 million in the third quarter compared to prior year quarter. Increase is mainly driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans which increased 19.2% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting expanded products and international growth.In the table on the right, you will see that adjusted net income of $27 million in the third quarter decreased $8 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the higher appliance and furniture claims severity and a higher mix of lower-margin business as we invest in growth at Allstate Protection Plans. These were partially offset by improved margins at Allstate Roadside and lower expenses at Allstate Identity Protection. Shifting to Slide 17. Our Health and Benefits business also had good results. Both revenues and income increased significantly with the National General acquisition in 2021 as we added scale and capabilities. For the third quarter of 2023, revenues of $587 million increased by $17 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in premiums, contract charges and other revenue in group health which was partially offset by a reduction in individual health and employer voluntary benefits.Adjusted net income of $69 million in the third quarter of 2023 increased $6 million compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to increases in group and individual health revenue and lower operating expenses. Now let's move to Slide 18 and discuss Allstate's approach to capital management to clarify how this differs from traditional methods used to evaluate capital such as the ratio of premiums to statutory surplus. On the left hand of the slide, we summarized 3 discrete components we evaluate to establish target capital which is the basis of our capital management framework. Base capital at the bottom is the capital required to meet ongoing operating requirements. Stress Capital is an additional layer of capital needed to cover tail events for the occurrence of multiple negative impacts, such as lower auto profitability and high catastrophe losses.The contingent reserve is for extremely low frequency and high severity events, a severe breakdown in diversification benefits and also provide strategic flexibility. We use a highly sophisticated model that breaks out individual risk types incorporates regulatory and rating agency considerations and uses extensive simulations to determine the right amount of capital for each component. This is more sophisticated and comprehensive than the ratio of premiums to surplus to determine the right amount of capital. For example, when calculating the premium to surplus ratio for the Allstate Insurance Company, the premiums for many of our subsidiary companies are included but over $1.6 billion of statutory capital is not included in the denominator.This framework also better assesses the use of catastrophe reinsurance particularly for large tail events then a simple ratio. Our sophisticated model and proactive actions provide flexibility to manage capital to maximize shareholder value creation. To close, let's turn to Slide 19 and recap all state strategic priorities. We continue making progress on our plan to return auto insurance profitability to targeted levels. We will pursue the divestiture of our Health and Benefits business, we're continuing to advance on our transformative growth initiatives. Proactive investment management has increased income. Allstate Protection Plans is expanding and these strategic priorities support value creation for Allstate shareholders.

A loss of $1.53 per share was reported in the prior-year quarter.Operating revenues improved 9% year over year to $14,583 million in the quarter under review, attributable to a 10% rise in property and casualty (P&C) insurance premiums. The top line missed the consensus mark by a whisker.The quarterly results benefited on the back of continued rate hikes, strong underwriting results and sound contribution from the Protection Services unit. However, the upside was partly offset by continued incidence of auto insurance loss costs, significant increase in catastrophe losses and an elevated expense level.The Allstate Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\xa0The Allstate Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Allstate Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Allstate Corporation Quote\xa0Q3 OperationsNet investment income of $689 million dipped 1% year over year in third quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $640 million as well as our estimate of $678.3 million. The metric suffered a blow due to a 44.5% year-over-year decline in performance-based investment income. Market-based investment income climbed 41% year over year.Total costs and expenses increased 2.8% year over year to $14,518 million but came lower than our estimate of $14,731.6 million. The year-over-year increase was due to an elevated P&C insurance claims and claim expense level.Allstate incurred a pretax loss of $21 million in the quarter under review, way narrower than the prior-year quarter’s loss of $910 million.Total policies in force were 190.1 million as of Sep 30, 2023, which increased 2.7% year over year.Catastrophe losses of $1,181 million soared 54.8% year over year in the third quarter but came lower than our estimate of $1,421.4 million.Segmental PerformancesThe Property-Liability segment’s premiums earned improved 10% year over year to $12,270 million in the third quarter, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,282 million but surpassed our estimate of $12,266.7 million. The metric was aided by rate increases resulting in improved average premiums. While the Allstate brand gained from growth in auto and homeowners average premium, an increase in the number of policies contributed to the results of National General.Story continuesThe unit incurred an underwriting loss of $414 million in the quarter under review, narrower than the prior-year quarter’s loss of $1,292 million and our estimate of $843.2 million. The loss narrowed on the back of higher premiums earned and a decline in unfavorable prior-year reserve reestimates. The combined ratio improved 820 basis points (bps) year over year to 103.4% in the quarter under review but came lower than the consensus mark of 104%.The Protection Services segment recorded revenues of $697 million, which rose 8.9% year over year in the third quarter, attributable to strength in Allstate Protection Plans. However, the metric lagged our estimate of $780.4 million. Adjusted net income dropped 22.9% year over year to $27 million due to increased severity of claims at Allstate Protection Plans. The figure also missed the consensus mark of $58 million.The Allstate Health and Benefits segment’s premium and contract charges remained flat year over year at $463 million in the third quarter, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $449 million. Favorable group health results were partly offset by weakness in individual health. Adjusted net income of $69 million rose 9.5% year over year, which outpaced the consensus mark of $57 million and our estimate of $47.4 million. The metric benefited on the back of strength in group and individual health coupled with reduced operating expenses.Financial Update (as of Sep 30, 2023)Allstate exited the third quarter with a cash balance of $860 million, which grew 16.8% from the 2022-end level. Total assets of $101.2 billion increased 3.3% from the figure at 2022 end.Debt amounted to $7,946 million, down 0.2% from the figure as of Dec 31, 2022.Total shareholders’ equity of $14,593 million fell 16.6% from the 2022-end figure.Book value per common share was $47.79 as of Sep 30, 2023, which tumbled 18.2% from the prior-year comparable period.The adjusted net income return on ALL’s common shareholders’ equity in the trailing 12-month period was a negative figure of 9.7%.

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) share price is up 41% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 13% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 8.4% , including dividends .Since the stock has added US$1.2b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. See our latest analysis for Allstate While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the last three years, Allstate failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 80% (annualized).Thus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Given this situation, it makes sense to look at other metrics too.It could be that the revenue growth of 8.6% per year is viewed as evidence that Allstate is growing. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthAllstate is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Allstate, it has a TSR of 53% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAllstate shareholders gained a total return of 8.4% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 10% per year for five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

EPS came in at $0.81, compared to -$1.56 in the year-ago quarter.The reported revenue compares to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.69 billion, representing a surprise of -0.74%. The company delivered an EPS surprise of +107.69%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $0.39.While investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.As these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.Here is how Allstate performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:Combined ratio - Property-liability: 103.4% versus 103.9% estimated by eight analysts on average.Loss ratio - Property-liability: 82.2% versus the seven-analyst average estimate of 83.4%.Expense ratio - Property-liability: 21.2% versus the seven-analyst average estimate of 20.7%.Loss ratio - Homeowners: 82.4% versus 79.3% estimated by four analysts on average.Property-Liability- Net Premiums Earned: $12.27 billion compared to the $12.28 billion average estimate based on eight analysts.

""Improved underwriting performance, strong investment income and profits from Protection Services and Health and Benefits generated adjusted net income* of $214 million, or $0.81 per diluted common share in the quarter. Property-Liability earned premium growth of 10.0% and execution of other components of the profit improvement plan improved the underlying combined ratio compared to the prior year quarter. Property-Liability had an underwriting loss in the quarter of $414 million, however, reflecting continued increases in auto insurance loss costs, elevated catastrophe losses and adverse prior year loss development. In response, we continue to raise auto and homeowners insurance prices, improve expense efficiencies, restrict growth in profit challenged states and enhance claims practices. The execution of these comprehensive actions will restore margins to target levels.""Story continues""We are pursuing the sale of Allstate’s Health and Benefits businesses since substantial value can be realized when aligned with a broader set of complementary businesses and product offerings. Allstate’s voluntary workplace benefits business was combined with National General’s group and individual health business, creating a broad-based benefits platform that serves 4.3 million policyholders and generated $240 million of adjusted net income over the last twelve months. This value creation was integral to the National General acquisition plan and now positions the business for additional growth and value enhancement. A sale would likely be completed in 2024.""""Significant progress has also been made in executing the strategy to increase property-liability market share and broaden protection provided to customers. Providing lowest cost protection requires continued cost reductions which is reflected in a lower expense ratio. Allstate exclusive agent productivity increased, excluding three states where profit improvement actions have reduced new business, and National General is growing through independent agents. Plans to increase growth in states that are achieving target auto insurance margins are now being initiated with further expansion planned for 2024. Allstate Protection Plans continues to grow its embedded protection offerings with U.S. retailers and internationally. Shareholder value will continue to grow with higher profitability, strategic capital allocation and organic long-term growth,"" concluded Wilson.Third Quarter 2023 ResultsTotal revenues of $14.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023 increased 9.8%, or $1.3 billion, compared to the prior year quarter driven by a $1.1 billion increase in Property-Liability earned premium due to higher average premiums.Net loss applicable to common shareholders was $41 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $685 million in the prior year quarter, due to improved Property-Liability underwriting results. Adjusted net income* was $214 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023, compared to an adjusted net loss* of $411 million in the prior year quarter. Restructuring expenses of $87 million were incurred during the third quarter of 2023 primarily related to the organizational component of Transformative Growth designed to streamline the organization and outsource operations.Property-Liability earned premium of $12.3 billion increased 10.0% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher average premiums from rate increases. The $414 million underwriting loss in the quarter decreased by $878 million compared to the prior year quarter, due to increased premiums earned and lower unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates, partially offset by higher losses.Property-Liability ResultsThree months endedSeptember 30,Nine months endedSeptember 30,($ in millions)20232022% / ptsChange20232022% / ptsChangePremiums earned$12,270$11,15710.0%$35,826$32,52910.1%Allstate brand10,2159,5177.330,06927,8168.1National General2,0551,64025.35,7574,71322.2Premiums written$13,304$12,03710.5%$37,707$34,3079.9%Allstate brand11,02010,3046.931,25029,2017.0National General2,2841,73331.86,4575,10626.5Underwriting income (loss)$(414)$(1,292)(68.0)%$(3,509)$(1,876)87.0%Allstate brand(168)(1,049)(84.0)(2,987)(1,623)84.0National General(167)(124)34.7(443)(133)NMRecorded combined ratio103.4111.6(8.2)109.8105.84.0Underlying combined ratio*91.996.4(4.5)92.793.6(0.9)Premiums written of $13.3 billion increased 10.5% compared to the prior year quarter driven by both the Allstate brand and National General. Allstate brand increased 6.9% primarily due to higher auto and homeowners average premium, partially offset by the impact of profitability actions on personal auto policies in force and commercial lines. National General increased 31.8% reflecting higher average premium and policies in force growth.Allstate brand underwriting loss in the third quarter of 2023 improved to $168 million compared to $1.0 billion in the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned premiums and favorable prior year reserve reestimates, excluding catastrophes, compared to unfavorable reestimates in the prior year, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.National General underwriting loss of $167 million in the third quarter of 2023 increased by $43 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher incurred losses as well as unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates, primarily related to personal auto. These were partially offset by higher earned premiums and a 4.4 point improvement in the expense ratio.Property-Liability underlying combined ratio* of 91.9 in the third quarter of 2023 improved 4.5 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by improved loss and expense ratios in Allstate brand auto, reflecting higher earned premiums and operating efficiencies. While loss trends have stabilized, claim severity increases remain elevated relative to historical levels and auto accident frequency continues to normalize to pre-pandemic levels.Allstate Protection auto insurance results reflect the impact of inflation in loss costs and the comprehensive plan to restore margins through higher rates, lower expenses, underwriting actions and claims process enhancements.

The increase was driven by higher average premium from rate increases, partially offset by a decline in policies in force.Allstate brand auto net written premium growth of 7.5% compared to the prior year quarter reflects a 15.7% increase in average gross written premium driven by rate increases, partially offset by a decline in policies in force from lower new business and retention.National General auto net written premium grew 35.3% compared to the prior year quarter driven by higher average premium and policies in force growth.Allstate brand auto rate increases were implemented in 25 locations in the third quarter at an average of 5.9%, resulting in an annualized total brand premium impact of 2.0% in the quarter and 9.5% through the first nine months of 2023. National General auto rate increases were implemented in 33 locations in the third quarter at an average of 6.2%, resulting in an annualized total brand premium impact of 3.3% in the quarter and 8.8% through the first nine months of 2023. We remain committed to the pursuit of additional rate increases as a core component of the profit improvement plan.The recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 102.1 in the third quarter of 2023 was 15.3 points lower than the prior year quarter, reflecting higher earned premiums, lower unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates and lower catastrophe losses.Prior year non-catastrophe reserve reestimates were unfavorable $27 million in the third quarter, reflecting adverse reserve development of $95 million for National General, partially offset by favorable Allstate brand reserve reestimates of $68 million.The underlying combined ratio* of 98.8 improved by 5.2 points from the prior year quarter as higher average premium and operating efficiencies were only partially offset by higher incurred losses from claim severity and accident frequency. Weighted average current report year incurred severity of Allstate brand major coverages is currently estimated to increase 9% compared to report year 2022, improving from estimates as of the second quarter 2023. The improvement in severity from claims reported in the first two quarters of the year represent a favorable impact of approximately 1.7 points on the third quarter underlying combined ratio. Excluding this impact, the third quarter underlying combined ratio* would have been 100.5.Allstate Protection homeowners insurance growth reflects higher rates and policies in force growth. Underwriting income was negatively impacted by elevated catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe claim severity.Allstate Protection Homeowners ResultsThree months endedSeptember 30,Nine months endedSeptember 30,($ in millions, except ratios)20232022% / ptsChange20232022% / ptsChangePremiums earned$2,969$2,64212.4%$8,662$7,69812.5%Allstate brand2,6132,35011.27,6386,84111.7National General35629221.91,02485719.5Premiums written$3,525$3,14512.1%$9,440$8,43411.9%Allstate brand3,1182,80311.28,2657,48810.4National General40734219.01,17594624.2Policies in Force (in thousands)7,2977,2370.8%Allstate brand6,6276,5990.4National General6706385.0Recorded combined ratio104.489.914.5122.893.829.0Catastrophe Losses$878$354148.0%$4,516$1,650173.7%Underlying combined ratio*72.974.1(1.2)69.470.6(1.2)Earned premiums increased by 12.4% and written premiums increased 12.1% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher average premium and policies in force growth of 0.8% compared to the third quarter of 2022.Allstate brand net written premium increased 11.2% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by an increase in average gross written premium due to implemented rate increases and inflation in insured home replacement costs.National General net written premium grew 19.0% compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to policies in force growth and higher average premium as rates were increased to improve underwriting margins.Allstate brand homeowners implemented rate increases in 12 locations in the third quarter at an average of 6.5%, resulting in an annualized total brand premium impact of 2.1% in the quarter and 9.5% through the first nine months of 2023. National General homeowners rate increases were implemented in 11 locations in the third quarter at an average of 17.6%, resulting in an annualized total brand premium impact of 1.2% in the quarter and 6.5% through the first nine months of 2023.The recorded homeowners insurance combined ratio of 104.4 was 14.5 points higher than the third quarter of 2022, due to higher catastrophe losses and severity, partially offset by premiums earned.Catastrophe losses of $878 million in the quarter increased $524 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily related to the Maui wildfire and a large Texas hailstorm.The underlying combined ratio* of 72.9 decreased by 1.2 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned premium and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe claim severity reflecting increases in labor and materials costs.Allstate business insurance strategy is being advanced through an equity investment and commercial partnership with NEXT Insurance, a high-growth, digital-first insurer with a proprietary technology platform for small business insurance. The partnership will allow both companies to expand the availability of their products across a broad distribution network and provides opportunity to co-develop unique products to serve the unmet needs of 33 million U.S. small businesses that increasingly want to purchase insurance digitally.Protection Services continues to broaden the protection provided to an increasing number of customers largely through embedded distribution programs. Revenues increased to $697 million in the third quarter of 2023, 8.9% higher than the prior year quarter, primarily due to Allstate Protection Plans. Adjusted net income of $27 million decreased by $8 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher claim severity at Allstate Protection Plans.Protection Services ResultsThree months endedSeptember 30,Nine months endedSeptember 30,($ in millions)20232022% / $Change20232022% / $ChangeTotal revenues (1)$697$6408.9%$2,054$1,8968.3%Allstate Protection Plans41634919.21,2001,01618.1Allstate Dealer Services1461432.14424176.0Allstate Roadside69656.21991942.6Arity2949(40.8)101163(38.0)Allstate Identity Protection37348.81121065.7Adjusted net income (loss)$27$35$(8)$102$131$(29)Allstate Protection Plans2029(9)79108(29)Allstate Dealer Services510(5)1827(9)Allstate Roadside71617413Arity(6)(2)(4)(13)(4)(9)Allstate Identity Protection1(3)41(4)5(1)Excludes net gains and losses on investments and derivatives.Allstate Protection Plans’ expanded products and international growth resulted in revenue of $416 million, $67 million or 19.2% higher than the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income of $20 million in the third quarter of 2023 was $9 million lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to the proportion of lower margin business and higher appliance and furniture claim severity.Allstate Dealer Services generated revenue of $146 million through auto dealers, which was 2.1% higher than the third quarter of 2022 due to higher earned premium. Adjusted net income of $5 million in the third quarter was $5 million lower than the prior year quarter driven by increased claim severity, higher expenses and restructuring charges.Allstate Roadside revenue of $69 million in the third quarter of 2023 increased 6.2% compared to the prior year quarter driven by price increases and new business growth. Adjusted net income was $6 million higher than the prior year quarter, primarily driven by increased pricing, lower loss severity from in-network sourcing and lower retail frequency.Arity revenue of $29 million decreased $20 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to reductions in insurance client advertising. Adjusted net loss of $6 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to a $2 million loss in the prior year quarter reflects lower revenue.Allstate Identity Protection revenue of $37 million in the third quarter of 2023 was 8.8% higher than the prior year quarter due to growth from new and existing clients. Adjusted net income of $1 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to a $3 million loss in the prior year quarter reflects lower expenses.Allstate Health and Benefits premiums and contract charges were flat compared to the prior year quarter as growth in group health was offset by lower individual health. Adjusted net income of $69 million in the third quarter of 2023 increased $6 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to increases in group and individual health and lower operating expenses.Allstate Health and Benefits Results (1)Three months endedSeptember 30,Nine months endedSeptember 30,($ in millions)20232022% Change20232022% ChangePremiums and contract charges$463$463—%$1,379$1,396(1.2)%Employer voluntary benefits253257(1.6)753777(3.1)Group health1119615.632828515.1Individual health99110(10.0)298334(10.8)Adjusted net income$69$639.5%$182$187(2.7)%(1)Prior periods have been recast to reflect the impact of the adoption of FASB guidance revising the accounting for certain long-duration insurance contracts.Allstate Investments $63.4 billion portfolio generated net investment income of $689 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $1 million from the prior year quarter due to lower performance-based results, mostly offset by higher market-based income.Allstate Investment ResultsThree months endedSeptember 30,Nine months endedSeptember 30,($ in millions, except ratios)20232022$ / ptsChange20232022$ / ptsChangeNet investment income$689$690$(1)$1,874$1,846$28Market-based (1)5674021651,6101,093517Performance-based (1)186335(149)439877(438)Net gains (losses) on investments and derivatives$(86)$(167)$81$(223)$(1,167)$944Change in unrealized net capital gains and losses, pre-tax$(855)$(1,009)$154$(325)$(4,506)$4,181Total return on investment portfolio(0.4)%(0.8)%0.42.1%(6.4)%8.5Total return on investment portfolio (trailing twelve months)4.6%(5.3)%9.9(1)Investment expenses are not allocated between market-based and performance-based portfolios with the exception of investee level expenses.Market-based investment income was $567 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $165 million, or 41.0%, compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher yields and extended duration of the $46.8 billion fixed income portfolio. Investment portfolio allocations, including extending duration and lowering equity risk over the last year, are based on expected risk adjusted returns and the enterprise risk and return position.Performance-based investment income totaled $186 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $149 million compared to the prior year quarter. Current quarter results reflect lower net gains on the sale of underlying investments than the prior year quarter. The portfolio allocation to performance-based assets has remained stable as these investments provide a diversifying source of higher long-term returns, despite volatility in reported results. Performance-based total return for the third quarter was 2.8% and was 5.4% through the first nine months of 2023. Quarterly total returns over the past 5 years have ranged from (2.3)% to 8.6%, while the 5- and 10-year IRR as of September 30, 2023 were 12.2% and 12.5%, respectively.Net losses on investments and derivatives totaled $86 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to $167 million in the prior year quarter. Net losses in the third quarter of 2023 were driven by sales of fixed income securities.Unrealized net capital losses were $3.2 billion, $855 million more than the prior quarter, as higher interest rates resulted in lower fixed income valuations.Total return on the investment portfolio was negative 0.4% in the quarter and positive 4.6% over the latest twelve months ended September 30, 2023.Proactive Capital Management""Allstate continues to proactively manage capital and has the financial flexibility, liquidity and capital resources to navigate the challenging operating environment and invest in growth. Our capital position remains sound with statutory surplus in the insurance companies of $13.5 billion and over $2.9 billion of assets are held at the holding company, representing 2.2 times annual fixed charges,"" said Jess Merten, Chief Financial Officer. ""We are making progress on the comprehensive profit improvement plan and remain confident strategic actions will result in profitable growth and attractive shareholder returns,"" concluded Merten.Visit www.allstateinvestors.com for additional information about Allstate’s results, including a webcast of its quarterly conference call and the call presentation.

Our methods for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.Adjusted net income is net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders, excluding:Net gains and losses on investments and derivativesPension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and lossesAmortization or impairment of purchased intangiblesGain or loss on dispositionAdjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two yearsRelated income tax expense or benefit of these itemsNet income (loss) applicable to common shareholders is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to adjusted net income.We use adjusted net income as an important measure to evaluate our results of operations. We believe that the measure provides investors with a valuable measure of the Company’s ongoing performance because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services business that may be obscured by the net effect of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses, amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles, gain or loss on disposition and adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items and the related tax expense or benefit of these items. Net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, and pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Gain or loss on disposition is excluded because it is non-recurring in nature and the amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles is excluded because it relates to the acquisition purchase price and is not indicative of our underlying business results or trends. Non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of our business or economic trends. Accordingly, adjusted net income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our business. A byproduct of excluding these items to determine adjusted net income is the transparency and understanding of their significance to net income variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods. Adjusted net income is used by management along with the other components of net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders to assess our performance. We use adjusted measures of adjusted net income in incentive compensation. Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders, adjusted net income and their components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing and evaluating our performance. We note that investors, financial analysts, financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize adjusted net income results in their evaluation of our and our industry’s financial performance and in their investment decisions, recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable, representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the Company and management’s performance. We note that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a forward-looking valuation technique uses adjusted net income as the denominator. Adjusted net income should not be considered a substitute for net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.The following tables reconcile net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders and adjusted net income. Taxes on adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders and adjusted net income (loss) generally use a 21% effective tax rate.($ in millions, except per share data)Three months ended September 30,ConsolidatedPer diluted common share2023202220232022Net loss applicable to common shareholders (1)$(41)$(685)$(0.16)$(2.55)Net (gains) losses on investments and derivatives861670.330.62Pension and other postretirement remeasurement (gains) losses149790.570.29Amortization of purchased intangibles83900.310.34(Gain) loss on disposition550.020.02Income tax expense (benefit)(68)(67)(0.26)(0.25)Adjusted net income (loss) * (1)$214$(411)$0.81$(1.53)Weighted average dilutive potential common shares excluded due to net loss applicable to common shareholders (1)1.52.9Nine months ended September 30,ConsolidatedPer diluted common share2023202220232022Net loss applicable to common shareholders (1)$(1,776)$(1,091)$(6.76)$(3.99)Net (gains) losses on investments and derivatives2231,1670.854.23Pension and other postretirement remeasurement (gains) losses56910.210.34Amortization of purchased intangibles2462640.940.96(Gain) loss on disposition4(6)0.02(0.02)Non-recurring costs (2)90—0.34—Income tax expense (benefit)(133)(313)(0.51)(1.12)Adjusted net income (loss) * (1)$(1,290)$112$(4.91)$0.40Weighted average dilutive potential common shares excluded due to net loss applicable to common shareholders (1)1.93.3_____________(1)In periods where a net loss or adjusted net loss is reported, weighted average shares for basic earnings per share is used for calculating diluted earnings per share because all dilutive potential common shares are anti-dilutive and are therefore excluded from the calculation.(2)Relates to settlement costs for non-recurring litigation that is outside of the ordinary course of business.Adjusted net income return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure. It is calculated by dividing the rolling 12-month adjusted net income by the average of Allstate common shareholders’ equity at the beginning and at the end of the 12-months, after excluding the effect of unrealized net capital gains and losses. Return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We use adjusted net income as the numerator for the same reasons we use adjusted net income, as discussed previously. We use average Allstate common shareholders’ equity excluding the effect of unrealized net capital gains and losses for the denominator as a representation of common shareholders’ equity primarily applicable to Allstate\'s earned and realized business operations because it eliminates the effect of items that are unrealized and vary significantly between periods due to external economic developments such as capital market conditions like changes in equity prices and interest rates, the amount and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. We use it to supplement our evaluation of net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders and return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity because it excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period. We believe that this measure is useful to investors and that it provides a valuable tool for investors when considered along with return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity because it eliminates the after-tax effects of realized and unrealized net capital gains and losses that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and that are driven by economic developments, the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by management. In addition, it eliminates non-recurring items that are not indicative of our ongoing business or economic trends. A byproduct of excluding the items noted above to determine adjusted net income return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity from return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity is the transparency and understanding of their significance to return on common shareholders’ equity variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods. We use adjusted measures of adjusted net income return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity in incentive compensation. Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to have adjusted net income return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity and return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity when evaluating our performance. We note that investors, financial analysts, financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize adjusted net income return on common shareholders’ equity results in their evaluation of our and our industry’s financial performance and in their investment decisions, recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable, representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the company and management’s utilization of capital. We also provide it to facilitate a comparison to our long-term adjusted net income return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity goal. Adjusted net income return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity should not be considered a substitute for return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.The following tables reconcile return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity and adjusted net income (loss) return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity.($ in millions)For the twelve months endedSeptember 30,20232022Return on Allstate common shareholders’ equityNumerator:Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders$(2,079)$(294)Denominator:Beginning Allstate common shareholders’ equity$15,713$24,515Ending Allstate common shareholders’ equity (1)12,59215,713Average Allstate common shareholders’ equity$14,153$20,114Return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity(14.7)%(1.5)%($ in millions)For the twelve months endedSeptember 30,20232022Adjusted net income (loss) return on Allstate common shareholders’ equityNumerator:Adjusted net income (loss) *$(1,641)$915Denominator:Beginning Allstate common shareholders’ equity$15,713$24,515Less: Unrealized net capital gains and losses(2,929)1,829Adjusted beginning Allstate common shareholders’ equity18,64222,686Ending Allstate common shareholders’ equity (1)12,59215,713Less: Unrealized net capital gains and losses(2,512)(2,929)Adjusted ending Allstate common shareholders’ equity15,10418,642Average adjusted Allstate common shareholders’ equity$16,873$20,664Adjusted net income (loss) return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity *(9.7)%4.4%_____________(1)Excludes equity related to preferred stock of $2,001 million and $1,970 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.Combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes, prior year reserve reestimates and amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles (""underlying combined ratio"") is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between four GAAP operating ratios: the combined ratio, the effect of catastrophes on the combined ratio, the effect of prior year non-catastrophe reserve reestimates on the combined ratio, and the effect of amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles on the combined ratio. We believe that this ratio is useful to investors, and it is used by management to reveal the trends in our Property-Liability business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses, prior year reserve reestimates and amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles. Catastrophe losses cause our loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio. Prior year reserve reestimates are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves, which could increase or decrease current year net income. Amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles relates to the acquisition purchase price and is not indicative of our underlying insurance business results or trends. We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance.

Furthermore, favorable renewals and organic business growth are likely to boost September-quarter results of companies like Aflac Incorporated AFL, MetLife, Inc. MET, American International Group, Inc. AIG, The Allstate Corporation ALL and Prudential Financial, Inc. PRU, which are set to announce quarterly numbers on Nov 2. However, potential hindrances might have arisen in the form of rising expenses and a challenging catastrophe environment.The insurance space belongs to the\xa0Finance\xa0sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification), overall earnings of which are projected to increase 12.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Revenues are expected to inch up 2.8%, as indicated by our latest Earnings Preview. The upward estimate for earnings is likely to have been supported by increased earned premiums, partially offset by higher expenses and catastrophe losses stemming from wind, hail and devastating wildfire events.Let’s delve deeper and look at the key factors that are likely to have impacted the insurance stocks during the quarter under review.Factors Setting the Tone for Insurance Stocks’ Q3 ResultsInsurance companies with exposure to the property and casualty business segment are expected to have incurred losses due to severe convective storms in the United States and Italy, as well as catastrophe losses resulting from the Maui wildfire. AON predicts that global insured losses from natural disasters will reach $88 billion by the third quarter-end. However, insurers may have mitigated the impact of these catastrophe losses and protected their underwriting results through favorable reserve development.Amid an active catastrophe environment, the insurance industry sees faster policy renewals, enabling insurers to raise rates for efficient claims processing. Enhanced pricing, exposure growth and client retention are likely to have boosted third-quarter premium generation. Diversified portfolios aimed at risk reduction further aided premium growth.Story continuesDuring the third quarter, increased business activities are expected to have driven heightened demand for insurance products. Insurers may have capitalized on this by diversifying and redesigning their offerings, resulting in revenue growth. Additionally, the pandemic's onset may have sustained growing awareness, further supporting insurance businesses.Increased global travel is anticipated to have driven higher auto insurance premiums. Elevated economic activities are likely to have benefited commercial and group insurance businesses in the third quarter. Companies with interest rate-sensitive products and investments are expected to have benefited from the high interest rate environment supporting investment income.Insurance companies are expected to have gained from improved operating efficiency in the third quarter, primarily due to accelerated digitalization and the influence of insurtech. Cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, blockchain, advanced analytics, cloud computing, telematics, and robotic process automation, have facilitated streamlined operations and cost reduction. These advancements are likely to have bolstered the margins of insurance companies during the quarter.Insurance Providers Reporting on\xa0Nov 1Against the backdrop discussed above, let’s find out how the following five companies are placed ahead of their third-quarter earnings release tomorrow.Our proprietary model clearly indicates that a company needs to have the right combination of two key elements — a positive\xa0Earnings ESP\xa0and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our\xa0Earnings ESP Filter.Aflac: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted revenues in Aflac U.S. indicates a 3.8% jump from the year-ago period’s actuals. The consensus mark for the segment’s pre-tax adjusted earnings indicates 4.1% year-over-year growth. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aflac’s total net earned premiums suggests a decline of 6.8% from the prior-year quarter due to weaker Japan operations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter earnings and top line stands at $1.44 per share and $4.5 billion, respectively, indicating an earnings increase of 17.1% but a revenue decline of 7.4% from the corresponding year-ago quarter’s actuals. As far as earnings surprises are concerned, Aflac’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average being 7.8%.

Also, the consensus mark for adjusted earnings in Latin America indicates a 16.7% jump from the year-ago period’s actuals.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter earnings and top line stands at $1.99 per share and $17.9 billion, respectively, indicating an earnings increase of 64.5% but a revenue decrease of 24.3% from the corresponding year-ago quarter’s actuals.

This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of -0.51% and a Zacks Rank #3.AIG: This leading multiline insurer’s third-quarter revenues are likely to have been supported by better net premiums earned in General Insurance. The consensus mark for the metric suggests a year-over-year increase of almost 4%. Improved retention, new business and continued growth in the insurance premium rate are likely to aid its results. Also, AIG’s Q3 earnings are expected to have gained from increased net investment income.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s bottom and top line is pegged at $1.55 per share and $12.6 billion, respectively, indicating an earnings increase of 134.9% and a revenue jump of 11.4% from the corresponding year-ago quarter’s readings.

The consensus mark for net premiums earned from Property-Liability and Protection Services segments suggests year-over-year increases of 10.1% and 14.9%, respectively. Prudent rate increases and strong policy retention rates are likely to aid its results. However, Allstate’s Q3 earnings may have taken a hit from pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.18 billion in the third quarter. Also, the homeowners business’ underwriting results are likely to have suffered from increasing loss costs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s bottom and top line is pegged at 39 cents per share and $14.7 billion, respectively, indicating an earnings improvement of 125% and a revenue increase of 14.7% from the corresponding year-ago quarter’s readings.

The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis, for purposes of determining executive and senior management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes. The Company also believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.Non-GAAP net income excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, non-cash interest expense, other special items as identified by management and described elsewhere in this press release, and the impact of non-GAAP tax rate to income tax expense, which approximates our tax rate excluding discrete items and other specific events that can fluctuate from period to period.Non-GAAP diluted common shares includes the diluted weighted average shares outstanding per GAAP regardless of whether the Company is in a loss position.Billings consists of total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue, excluding deferred revenue from acquisitions.Adjusted EBITDA represents net income adjusted for income tax expense, interest expense, interest income and other, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges and other special items as identified by management and described elsewhere in this press release.Free cash flow consists of cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.Non-GAAP gross profit represents gross profit adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense and other special items as identified by management and described elsewhere in this press release.Non-GAAP operating expense represents operating expense excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges and other special items as identified by management and described elsewhere in this press release.Company management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Altair urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.Reconciliation tables of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release.About AltairAltair is a global leader in computational science and artificial intelligence (AI) that provides software and cloud solutions in simulation, high-performance computing (HPC), data analytics and AI.

of certain indirect costs to reflect the way management is now reviewing the information in decision making and to improve comparability with peers. These indirect costs include certain IT, facilities, and depreciation expenses that were previously reported primarily in General and administrative expense. These indirect costs have now been reclassified to Research and development, Sales and marketing, and General and administrative expenses based on global headcount. Management believes this refined methodology better reflects the nature of the costs and financial performance of the Company.As a result, the Company’s consolidated statements of operations have been recast for prior periods presented to reflect the effects of the changes to Research and development, Sales and marketing, and General and administrative expense. There was no net impact to total operating expenses, income from operations, net income or net income per share for any periods presented. The consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, and the consolidated statements of cash flows were not affected by changes in the presentation of these costs.Each prior period that will be presented in the forthcoming Form 10-Q and Form 10-K filings will be recast to conform to current period presentation. The following tables provide the relevant financial results as previously reported, as recast for the current period and forthcoming filings, and the associated impacts of the changes. Within these tables, the references to periods such as “FY 2021” and “Q1 2022” refer to the corresponding periods as reported in the applicable Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, or Form 8-K filings.The following

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term Altair Engineering Inc. (NASDAQ:ALTR) shareholders have enjoyed a 94% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 50% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 35% in the last year.Since it's been a strong week for Altair Engineering shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Altair Engineering Altair Engineering wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.For the last half decade, Altair Engineering can boast revenue growth at a rate of 8.7% per year. That's a fairly respectable growth rate. While the share price has beat the market, compounding at 14% yearly, over five years, there's certainly some potential that the market hasn't fully considered the growth track record. The key question is whether revenue growth will slow down, and if so, how quickly. There's no doubt that it can be difficult to value pre-profit companies.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthYou can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Altair Engineering shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 35% over one year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 14%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.

(NYSE:MO) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today\'s value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it\'s not too difficult to follow, as you\'ll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company\'s value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Altria Group Is Altria Group Fairly Valued?We\'re using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company\'s growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today\'s value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.53bUS$8.05bUS$7.38bUS$7.03bUS$6.85bUS$6.78bUS$6.77bUS$6.81bUS$6.88bUS$6.97bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -2.51%Est @ -1.11%Est @ -0.13%Est @ 0.55%Est @ 1.03%Est @ 1.37% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$8.0kUS$7.1kUS$6.1kUS$5.5kUS$5.0kUS$4.6kUS$4.3kUS$4.1kUS$3.9kUS$3.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$52bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today\'s value at a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.0b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.2%) = US$162bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$162b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$86bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$138b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$39.9, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don\'t agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company\'s future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company\'s potential performance. Given that we are looking at Altria Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we\'ve used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.878. Beta is a measure of a stock\'s volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Altria GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for MO.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won\'t be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you\'d apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company\'s valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global cigar market, the rising popularity of flavored cigars, and a recent acquisition in the cigar industry, and go directly to 5 Most Expensive Cigars in the World.\xa0Cigars have long held a captivating allure, entwined with luxury, leisure, and the rich history of indulgence. During the 19th and 20th centuries, cigars were a must-have element of every gentleman’s club and bar lounge. Smoke rooms started to capture conversations of politics and business deals, and as such, the constant presence of cigars became associated with success. Moreover, the elegant craftsmanship and intricate flavors of cigars have made them not only a\xa0 symbol of status but also an embodiment of culture and tradition.Global Cigar Market:\xa0According to Persistence Market Research, sales of cigars and cigarillos currently account for 3% to 5% share of the global tobacco products market. The global cigar and cigarillo market currently stands at around $21.23 billion and is expected to reach $32.3 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 4.3% during the forecast period. A major reason for the recent growth is the fact that cigars have started gaining popularity among younger adult consumers in many countries, reversing a decades-long downward trend.As one of the Countries with the Highest Tobacco Consumption, it doesn’t come as a surprise that the U.S. is the world’s largest market for cigars, with an estimated revenue of $12.7 billion in 2023 so far. Historically, cigar smoking in the United States has been a behavior of older men, but the industry’s increased marketing of these products to targeted groups has increased the prevalence of use among adolescents.The Rising Popularity of Flavored Cigars:Flavors improve the taste and mask the harshness of tobacco, making flavored tobacco products more appealing and easier to smoke for beginners, who are often young. In 2022, cigars were the second most commonly used tobacco product among U.S. middle and high school students. The availability of flavors in cigars that are prohibited in cigarettes (such as cherry), and the fact that they are commonly sold as a single stick, has raised concerns that these products may be especially appealing to youth. According to a 2021 survey by the CDC, among middle and high school students who smoked cigars in the previous 30 days, 44.4% reported using a flavored cigar during that time.Story continuesA popular name among the machine made, flavored cigars is Middleton’s Black and Mild. Designed for the occasional smoker, these pipe tobacco cigars boast a smoke smooth enough to satisfy an aficionado in a pinch. Owned by Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Black & Mild cigars are available in a variety of flavors like apple, cherry, cream, and more.\xa0The John Middleton Co., a famous name in the pipe tobacco and machine cigars industry, was acquired by the Richmond-based Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) in 2007 in a deal worth $2.9 billion, thus enabling the tobacco giant to break into the growing American cigar business as it tried to expand beyond the shrinking U.S. cigarette market. The net cost of the acquisition of Middleton, maker of Black & Mild cigars, from privately held Bradford Holdings was $2.2 billion after deducting $700 million in tax benefits arising from the deal.Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) ranks among the 11 Best Stocks to Buy for Income.\xa0Recent Acquisition in the Cigar Industry:\xa0It was revealed earlier this year that the Scandinavian Tobacco Group A/S (CPH:STG) – one of the largest cigar companies in the world – has agreed to acquire Alec Bradley Cigar Distributors for $72.5 million. The deal includes all of Alec Bradley’s cigar brands, which are made under contract by other cigar companies. In 2022, Alec Bradley sold almost 10 million cigars – up 5% from 2021 – and its brands include Alec & Bradley Kintsugi, Alec Bradley Double Broadleaf, and Alec Bradley Prensado, which was named Cigar Aficionado’s Cigar of the Year for 2011.\xa0The Denmark-based Scandinavian Tobacco Group A/S (CPH:STG) is a company with more than $1.2 billion in annual sales last year and some 10,000 employees worldwide. It’s the parent organization of General Cigar Co., which makes a vast array of handmade cigars including Macanudo, CAO, La Gloria Cubana and the non-Cuban Cohiba, Punch, and Hoyo de Monterrey brands, among many others.\xa0The Scandinavian Tobacco Group A/S (CPH:STG) had already been on a shopping spree in the cigar industry over the last few years. Last summer, it acquired the Room101 cigar brand from Matt Booth, in 2019 it bought Royal Agio, in 2018 it bought retailer Thompson and Co., and earlier deals include brands such as Toraño and those of Leccia Tobacco Co.With that said, here are the Costliest Cigars in the World.\xa012 Most Expensive Cigars in the World in 2023Pixabay/Public DomainMethodology:To collect data for this article, we have referred to a number of sources such as Cigar Aficionado, Luxhabitat, Havana House, and Reddit etc., looking for the Most Expensive Cigars. The following cigars have been ranked by their dollar retail price in the current international market.\xa0It must be kept in mind that cigar prices can often vary across different markets around the world, so we have mentioned the retail prices mentioned in the most number of reliable sources we could find online.12. The Oliva Serie V Roaring Twenties Super Limited EditionCurrent Retail Price: $300The Roaring Twenties were a period of rapid economic growth and social change. People danced, smoked, and celebrated as the world came out of WWI. A century later, the Oliva Cigar Co. is releasing a cigar named after those heady times, and the smokes are even adorned with gold. According to reports, there will be 300 boxes of 10 cigars made, and 200 of the boxes will go to the U.S.Since 1886 the Oliva family has been hand-crafting the finest cigars in the industry, primarily grown and produced in Nicaragua and sold internationally. The Republic of Nicaragua is counted among the Countries that Produce the Best Tobacco in the World.\xa011. Cohiba Siglo de OroCurrent Retail Price: $300On the occasion of the commemoration of the arrival of the Year of the Rabbit, Habanos, S.A. unveiled its new Cohiba Siglo de Oro vitola, a novel product from the Cohiba brand, the most prestigious in the world of Habanos.\xa0The Pacific Cigar Co. LTD and Infifon HK, exclusive distributors of Habanos, S.A., presented Cohiba Siglo de Oro at an event held simultaneously in several Asian countries. This vitola is the first to include NFC technology in its cases, which allows aficionados to verify its authenticity and learn more details about the product.With a hefty price tag of $300 per cigar, the Cohiba Siglo de Oro is counted among the Priciest Cigars in 2023.\xa010. Cohiba 55 AniversarioCurrent Retail Price: $300The Cohiba 55 Aniversario Limited Edition 2021 marks one more milestone in the grand history of the Cohiba brand and honors this iconic Habanos’ flagship. Each cigar, exceptionally rolled with the finest tobacco leaves from the Vuelta Abajo region, is finished with the classic characteristic of the Cohiba line – the pigtail.The hefty smoke had a series of launch parties throughout last year, starting with Cyprus and Lebanon in May and then Havana in September. There were small launch parties in Hong Kong, Malaysia, and other countries in southeast Asia as well.\xa0Arguably the most famous cigar brand in the world, Cohiba was created as the personal smoke of Fidel Castro in 1966.\xa09. Cohiba BehikeCurrent Retail Price: $450The Cohiba Behike range is often considered to be the greatest Cuban cigars ever made. These cigars are constantly in high demand but are an incredibly exclusive luxury range with a limited annual production. Made from an exquisite blend of top-quality Cuban tobacco, these medium-bodied cigars offer the ultimate taste and aroma of a Habano.In the summer of 2022, Cuba’s Habanos S.A. normalized prices on its cigars, pegging pricing of brands such as Cohiba and Trinidad to the Hong Kong standard. Habanos S.A. is a joint venture, co-owned by the Cuban government and a secretive ownership group, once known as Allied Cigar Corporation, out of Hong Kong.\xa0The Cohiba Behike sits among the Top 10 Most Expensive Cigars in the World in 2023.\xa08. Davidoff Oro BlancoCurrent Retail Price: $600This is the most exceptional cigar Davidoff has ever created. Oro Blanco consists of the rarest tobacco, harvested in 2000-2001 in one of the richest soils in all of the Dominican Republic, where the Mao, Gurabo, and the Yaque Del Norte rivers weave their way through the Mao zone.

Notably, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note briefly surpassed the 5% mark, a level not seen in 16 years, which further contributed to investor concerns. They are now looking more at assets that generate income due to the current uncertainty. A strong income-focused portfolio combines various income-generating assets like bonds, dividend stocks, and real estate. This mix helps lower risks and enhances the potential for steady, long-term returns.Also read: 12 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive IncomeDividend stocks offer more than just income; they create a virtuous cycle of growth. Strong dividend growth is beneficial for investors in several ways. It can enhance returns and act as a shield against inflation by offering a steadily increasing income stream, much like an annual raise in your earnings. Additionally, dividend-growing stocks have the potential for price appreciation because they often reflect a company's improving earnings and dividend payments over time. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, historically, large-cap dividend-growing stocks have shown resilience during market downturns, experienced smaller losses, and performed well when the market remained stable. In addition, they've managed to capture a significant portion of the market's upswings during more favorable economic conditions. The report also mentioned that over the period from 1985 to 2022, companies that increased their dividends within the Russell 1000 Index outperformed the overall market index, and they did so with less volatility.Lower volatility is one of the factors that attract investors to dividend stocks. The reduced price fluctuations in dividend stocks can provide a sense of stability and predictability in an investor's portfolio, which is especially appealing to those who prioritize income generation and want to avoid significant market ups and downs. Wisdom Tree reported that over the past 64 years, dividend levels decreased in just six years, and only once did they drop by more than 5%. In contrast, stock prices experienced declines in 18 of those 64 years, with the worst yearly drop exceeding 40% and an average decline of over 11%. This data suggests that stock prices are significantly more volatile than the cash flows from dividends.Story continuesSome of the best stocks to buy for income include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Altria Group (NYSE:MO). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for Altria Group How Fast Is Altria Group Growing Its Earnings Per Share?In the last three years Altria Group's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. In impressive fashion, Altria Group's EPS grew from US$2.58 to US$4.94, over the previous 12 months. It's a rarity to see 91% year-on-year growth like that.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. It seems Altria Group is pretty stable, since revenue and EBIT margins are pretty flat year on year. While this doesn't ring alarm bells, it may not meet the expectations of growth-minded investors.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Altria Group.Story continuesAre Altria Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$70b company like Altria Group. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. To be specific, they have US$48m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. While their ownership only accounts for 0.07%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.Is Altria Group Worth Keeping An Eye On?Altria Group's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Altria Group for a spot on your watchlist.

With that, I’ll turn the call over to Billy.Story continuesBilly Gifford: Thanks Mac. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our highly profitable produced traditional tobacco businesses were resilient in a dynamic operating environment during the third quarter and first nine months, providing fuel for our business transformation and significant cash returns to our shareholders. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 3.3% for the first nine months and returned more than $5.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to balance maximizing profitability from our smokeable and moist smokeless tobacco businesses with investments to realize their vision of responsibly leading the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future. This morning I will focus on our progress with NJOY, the state of the e-vapor category, and the encouraging third quarter results from on.I'll then turn it over to Sal, who will providing update on consumer and industry dynamics, further detail on our financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Let's begin in the e-vapor category. In our first full quarter of ownership, our teams executed NJOY's business plans with speed and focus to lay the foundation for NJOY’s long-term success. Today, NJOY ACE remains the only pod based e-vapor product with a marketing authorization from the FDA. We're actively working to bring this compelling smoke-free alternative for more smokers in vapors across the United States. We believe that the long-term success in e-vapor will be influenced by our actions in the near term, and we're executing in the marketplace to grow the business responsibly and sustainably.First, while already strong strengthening NJOY supply chain was a necessary step to begin the initial phase of our expansion with ACE. Our teams work diligently to solidify the entire supply chain from sourcing direct materials through the shipment to retail. As a result, we do not anticipate capacity constraints as we execute our initial expansion plan. Next, during the third quarter, our teams prioritize closing inventory gaps at retail and expanding distribution of ACE. Prior to the acquisition, NJOY had a small scale salesforce, which resulted in inventory volatility and significant distribution gaps at retail. Upon completion of the NJOY transaction, we immediately unleashed our salesforce to focus on closing the inventory gaps in stores that already had distribution.We improved inventory conditions in stores and are actively working to close remaining gaps at retail. For expansion based distribution grew to approximately 42,000 stores during the third quarter and is now distributed in all of the top 25 convenience store chains by e-vapor volume. In addition, we began to amplify visibility with new point of sale and fixture signage at retail. During the fourth quarter, we continue to expect ACE expansion to reach a total of 70,000 stores by year-end, representing approximately 70% of e-vapor volume and 55% of cigarette volume sold in the US multi outlet and convenience channel. As we continue to expand distribution and close inventory gaps, we expect to further enhance visibility and product fixture space at retail.Last month, NJOY unveil its first retail trade program. Retail partners can sign up for the program at various levels with merchandising options designed to position NJOY strategically and responsibly to tobacco consumers, while creating further awareness of the brand. And as we move to our next phase of e-vapor consumer engagement, we're beginning to test a variety of promotional plans and anticipate more disruptive execution at retail in the fourth quarter. Moving into 2024. We will continue to refine our promotional plans, implement, NJOY's retail trade program, further expand distribution and evolve our consumer engagement strategy. Our strategies will focus on informing adult vapors and smokers of the attributes of ACE, such as battery capacity and pods size relative to other leading brands, generating trial and growing brand loyalty.In addition, plans for a new brand equity campaign are well underway. We expect to equity campaign to further amplify the brand's presence at retail and drive consumer engagement with the brand. We're excited to share more on this campaign and the next phases of our growth plans in the near future. Looking more broadly at the e-vapor category, the current state of the market is intolerable for both legitimate manufacturers and consumers. As we have noted repeatedly four months, the regulated market is being overrun by illegal flavored disposable e-vapor products made and distributed by companies violating virtually every rule and guidance FDA has issued since 2016. Regulation not enforced is indistinguishable from no regulation at all. Illegal e-vapor products circumvent the actions of regulators, responsible manufacturers and retailers by evading scientific review, quality of manufacturing controls, marketing oversight, and legal aids or purchase restrictions.Despite recent actions by the FDA, enforcement has been inadequate and ineffective. We believe the FDA has the tools necessary to bring order to the market. For our part, we're actively engaged with regulators, state and federal lawmakers and trade partners and other stakeholders to build awareness of these serious issues and drive marketplace enforcement. We have also taken more targeted, but necessary action and initiated litigation in the United States District Court in California against 34 organizations, including manufacturers, distributors and online retailers related to the sale of unlawful products. A strong course correction is needed to protect the tobacco farm reduction opportunity for the 30 million adult smokers in the US. Turning to oral tobacco.The nicotine pouch category experienced sizable growth once again, resulting in an estimated 5% increase in total US oral tobacco volumes over the past six months. Full nicotine pouches grew nearly 10 share points year-over-year and now represent more than 32% and the US oral tobacco category. on! participated in the category growth as third quarter reported shipment volumes increased nearly 37% versus the year ago period. During the quarter, Helix focused on continued volume growth, while improving profitability. Helix applied its evolving analytical resources to be more flexible with its promotions in the marketplace. As a result, on!'s retail price increased 33% per can sequentially and 52% versus the prior year, closing the gap [indiscernible] in by over $1 year-over-year.A close-up of an assembly line with a blend of tobacco products.Encouragingly, we continue to see increasing level of both trial and adoption of the brand with repeat purchases up more than 35% year-over-year despite the substantial increase in retail price. In addition, on's! retail share of the oral tobacco category was 6.9%, up 1.7 share points versus the prior year and stable sequentially. Internationally, on! PLUS began its test launch in Sweden, one of the largest modern oral tobacco markets in the world. And consumers are engaging with the brand through both e-commerce and select retail locations. While still early days, we are encouraged by the feedback we've received from consumers. Initial consumer data showed that on! PLUS performed well in the areas of comfort, flavor and overall satisfaction.We believe that on! PLUS' long-lasting flavor system and proprietary software material are differentiators in the category. We are at an exciting period in our history. We have an unprecedented opportunity to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to our smoke-free future. Our smoke-free portfolio is compelling, and I am encouraged by our initial progress with NJOY and on's! strong performance. I believe we have the appropriate strategy. on! people in place to execute our growth plans. I continue to believe that we can achieve our vision and create long-term value for our shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.Sal Mancuso: Thanks Billy. Let's begin with an update on consumer and industry dynamics. During the third quarter, cigarette industry volume declines continued to be elevated from their historical levels, due in part to macroeconomic factors, and the growth of illegal favored disposable e-vapor products. By design, illicit products are largely distributed through non-traditional untracked channels requiring us to refine our ability to estimate their impacts on the industry. With the information we have today, we believe that there is more cross-category movement than previously assumed. And we now estimate that growth of illegal flavor disposable e-vapor products contributed to industry, cigarette industry declines in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% and over the last 12 months.These updated estimates have been reflected in our decomposition of cigarette industry decline rates. We will continue to monitor this dynamic trend and are actively pursuing better data sources to enhance our estimates in this space. Turning to results for the quarter. The Smokeable Products segment continued to deliver on its strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles over the long-term, while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products. In fact, during the third quarter, the Smokable Products segment expanded adjusted OCI margins while Marlboro grew its retail share sequentially in the cigarette category and within the Premium segment. Adjusted operating companies income declined by 2.5% in the third quarter, but grew by 0.2% for the first nine months.The adjusted OCI declined during the third quarter was primarily driven by elevated industry volume declines due to the factors I mentioned and higher promotional investments. As a reminder, there was also one fewer shipping day in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 0.7% and 0.9% in the third quarter and the first nine months, respectively. Net pricing remained robust, and net price realization for the segment was 8.6% in the third quarter and 9.8% for the first nine months. Marlboro was resilient during the quarter and its retail share of the cigarette category grew 0.3% sequentially to 42.3%, while declining 0.3% versus the year ago period. Promotional investments across the Marlboro portfolio, such as investments in Marlboro Black supported the strong share performance for the quarter.Additionally, Marlboro grew its share within the stable Premium segment to 58.9%, an increase of 0.3% sequentially and 0.4% year-over-year, while other brands ceded share in the Premium segment sequentially and year-over-year. Total discount segment share grew 1.1 percentage points year-over-year to 28.2%, but has been flat since the first quarter of 2023. We believe the recent stability in discount is an encouraging sign, considering the adverse macroeconomic conditions impacting smokers in the premium position of our portfolio. Smokeable Products segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 11.6% in the third quarter and 10.5% for the first nine months. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, third quarter domestic cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 10%.For the first nine months, adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 10.5%. At the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8% in the third quarter and for the first nine months. In Cigars, John Middleton reported exceptional performance through the first nine months and cigar shipment volume increased 4.2%. The Oral Tobacco Products Segment reported strong results during the quarter. As adjusted OCI and OCI margins increased while on! continued to grow its retail share of the oral tobacco category year-over-year. For the third quarter, adjusted OCI grew 7.1% and the segment expanded adjusted OCI margins to 69.3%, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points versus the prior year. This performance was supported by robust net price realization due in part to the more efficient on! promotional investments, Billy described earlier.For the first nine months, the segment grew adjusted OCI by 4.1%, with adjusted OCI margins of 68.9%, up nearly 1 percentage point. Total segment reported shipment volume decreased by 3.3% and 2.3% for the third quarter and for the first nine months, respectively. The segment's volume decline was driven by declines in MSP volumes, partially offset by the growth of on!. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, segment volumes declined by an estimated 2% and 2.5% for the third quarter and first nine months, respectively. Oral Tobacco Products Segment retail share declined 4.2 percentage points in the third quarter as declines in our MSP brands were partially offset by the year-over-year growth of on!.

In the third quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and raised our dividend by 4.3% in August, in line with our new progressive dividend goal. This increase marked our 58th increase in the last 54 years, and repurchased 5.9 million shares for $260 million.

AMZN,"[""AMZNeditorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)November 4, 2023 at 4:00 AM·2 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowAMZNWatchlistGenerally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) shareholders have enjoyed a 62% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 51% (not including dividends).The past week has proven to be lucrative for Amazon.com investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. See our latest analysis for Amazon.com To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Amazon.com managed to grow its earnings per share at 16% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. Having said that, the market is still optimistic, given the P/E ratio of 71.33.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Amazon.com shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 52% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 10% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Before spending more time on Amazon.com it might be wise to click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling shares.Story continuesWe will like Amazon.com better if we see some big insider buys.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 8, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.37 billion, up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.96% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ameren?For Ameren, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.22%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Ameren will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ameren would post earnings of $0.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.90, delivering a surprise of +15.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ameren appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerDominion Energy (D), another stock in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.78 for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -29.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.29 billion, down 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Dominion Energy has been revised 14.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.92%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dominion Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sempra Energy has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.81%, on average. Factors to NoteIn the third quarter, some parts of Sempra Energy’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures. Such weather patterns are likely to have boosted the electricity demand for cooling purposes among the company’s customers in summer. This is expected to have boosted revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, strong load growth is likely to have benefited Sempra’s third-quarter revenue performance.However, some parts of Sempra Energy’s service territories experienced extreme weather conditions like tornados, accompanied by gusty winds and the Hurricane Hilary storm, which may have dampened the smooth flow of electricity among SRE customers. This is likely to have impacted the company’s third-quarter revenues to some extent.From the cost perspective, storms, along with gusty winds, may have caused infrastructural damage for Sempra Energy, thereby increasing the company’s operation and maintenance expenses to repair the damage. This might have hurt SRE’s third-quarter bottom line. However, this may have been more than offset by a strong top line, which is likely to have contributed to Sempra Energy’s third-quarter bottom line.Q3 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.82 billion. This indicates a 5.6% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.01 per share. This calls for 2% growth from the prior-year reported figure.Sempra Energy Price and EPS SurpriseSempra Energy Price and EPS SurpriseSempra Energy price-eps-surprise | Sempra Energy QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Sempra Energy this time.

But it’s worth taking a look at Southern Company’s previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q2 Earnings & Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider beat the consensus mark on lower-than-expected operating expenses. Southern Company had reported adjusted earnings per share of 79 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents. However, revenues of $5.7 billion came in 15.7% below the consensus mark, affected by tepid demand on the back of unfavorable weather, to go with the negative effects of rates, usage and pricing changes.SO topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed in the other. The utility has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.2%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Southern Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company (The) price-eps-surprise | Southern Company (The) Quote\xa0Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter bottom line has been revised 1.5% downward in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 0.8% improvement year over year. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues suggests a slight 0.01% decline from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderSouthern Company's seven major regulated utilities serve approximately nine million electric and natural gas customers. Leveraging the demographics of its operating territories, the firm has been successfully expanding its regulated business customer base. As proof of that effort, Southern Company added more than 24,000 new residential electric customers and in excess of 13,000 residential natural gas customers in the first half of 2023. This trend most likely continued in the July-September period of 2023 because of healthy economic development across its service territories.On a somewhat bearish note, the power supplier’s fuel and retail electric sales in the second quarter might have been affected by tepid weather, which translates into lesser use of natural gas required to run electricity generators. This, in turn, is likely to have dragged down overall sales. In particular, our estimate for operating revenues is pegged at $8 billion, indicating a 4.2% drop from $8.4 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Southern Company is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Southern Company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.32 per share each.Zacks Rank: SO currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult this earnings season.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company, here are some firms from the utilities space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:Consolidated Edison ED has an Earnings ESP of +3.93% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Duke Energy has a trailing four-quarter average negative earnings surprise of 3.03%.Factors to NoteIn the third quarter, the majority of DUK’s service territories experienced warmer-than-normal temperatures, which can be projected to have boosted electricity demand from the company’s customers during this year’s summer. This, in turn, must have bolstered the company’s quarterly top-line performance.Duke Energy Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseDuke Energy Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseDuke Energy Corporation price-eps-surprise | Duke Energy Corporation QuoteFavorable rate hikes and strong customer growth might have positively contributed to Duke Energy’s third-quarter revenues. However, parts of its service areas witnessed some severe weather impacts in the to-be-reported quarter, including a handful of tropical storms that brought in flash floods and hails. These, in turn, caused widespread outages. Such outages might have adversely impacted the company’s revenues to some extent.From the cost perspective, operation and maintenance costs to restore damages caused by the aforementioned tropical storms must have had an adverse impact on DUK’s third-quarter earnings. Nevertheless, the company’s cost mitigation initiatives to address rising interest rate and inflation headwinds, along with solid sales growth, must have bolstered its bottom line performance in the third quarter.Q3 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $8.13 billion, indicating an increase of 2% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.94 per share, indicating a 9% improvement year over year.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Duke Energy this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that is not the case here.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -1.21%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: DUK currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderHere are three Utility players that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this reporting cycle.Consolidated Edison ED has an Earnings ESP of +3.93% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The company delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 8.22%.Consolidated Edison boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ED’s third-quarter earnings and sales is pegged at $1.58 per share and $3.82 billion, respectively.NiSource NI has an Earnings ESP of +18.52% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 14 cents per share, implying a 40% increase from that reported in the prior-year quarter.The consensus mark for NI’s sales is pinned at $1.06 billion. The company has a trailing four-quarter average negative earnings surprise of 5.61%.Ameren AEE has an Earnings ESP of +0.22% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. The consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings is pinned at $1.80 per share, indicating a 3.5% increase year over year.Ameren boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 8.86%. The consensus mark for third-quarter sales is pegged at $2.37 billion, indicating growth of 2.9% from that recorded in the prior-year quarter.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is worth considering Ameren (AEE), which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry.This utility has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 10.88%.For the last reported quarter, Ameren came out with earnings of $0.90 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.78 per share, representing a surprise of 15.38%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.94 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1 per share, delivering a surprise of 6.38%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Ameren lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Ameren has an Earnings ESP of +0.22% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 8, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Operating earnings for third-quarter 2023 were $924 million or $1.77 per share, compared with operating earnings of $831 million or $1.62 per share in third-quarter 2022.Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure representing GAAP earnings excluding special items. The difference between 2023 GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter was largely due to the mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities. A full reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date is included in the tables at the end of this news release.""Our earnings growth this quarter was driven by our long-term strategy to invest in a modern, reliable energy system to meet the evolving needs of our customers while keeping electricity rates affordable,"" said Julie Sloat, AEP chair, president and chief executive officer. ""Our team has delivered these results in the face of high interest rates, inflation and unfavorable weather by actively managing the business, controlling costs and executing on our flexible and robust capital plan to help meet our stakeholder commitments.Story continues""We are narrowing our operating earnings guidance range to $5.24 to $5.34, maintaining the midpoint of $5.29 and reaffirming our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% and FFO/Debt target of 14%-15%. On Oct. 24, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to 88 cents a share, in line with our earnings growth rate.""AEP is taking action to de-risk and simplify our business. We completed the sale of our 1,365-megawatt unregulated renewables portfolio in August, netting approximately $1.2 billion. We remain on track with the previously announced sales processes for our retail and distributed resources businesses, our share of a renewable energy joint venture and two non-core transmission joint ventures. We also are continuing our strategic review of the Transource Energy joint venture, which we expect to complete this year,"" Sloat said.""We\'ve made significant progress on our five-year, $8.6 billion regulated renewables investment plan, with $6 billion in approved projects and $800 million currently pending commission approval. These projects provide fuel savings for our customers and are aligned with our integrated resource plans. The transmission and distribution investments we\'re making to enhance service and reliability for customers also continue to support our earnings results.""Commercial load increased 7.5% year over year, largely driven by our focus on economic development in the communities we serve. We\'ve added nearly 30,000 new residential customers in our service territory this year, which has helped offset lower average usage in the residential segment. We continue to see a softening of industrial load from the impacts of higher interest rates but still expect overall retail load to grow in 2024,"" Sloat said.SUMMARY OF RESULTS BY SEGMENT$ in millions\xa0GAAP Earnings3Q 233Q 22VarianceYTD 23YTD 22VarianceVertically Integrated Utilities (a)512.5476.935.61,051.61,076.3(24.7)Transmission & Distribution Utilities (b)206.0165.540.5508.4483.125.3AEP Transmission Holdco (c)202.9170.532.4580.8485.495.4Generation & Marketing (d)130.797.533.2(59.3)284.3(343.6)All Other(98.4)(226.7)128.3(209.6)(406.2)196.6Total GAAP Earnings (Loss)953.7683.7270.01,871.91,922.9(51.0)Operating Earnings (non-GAAP)3Q 233Q 22VarianceYTD 23YTD 22VarianceVertically Integrated Utilities (a)520.0499.820.21,045.61,099.2(53.6)Transmission & Distribution Utilities (b)206.0165.540.5488.2483.15.1AEP Transmission Holdco (c)202.9170.532.4580.9485.495.5Generation & Marketing (d)92.870.022.8204.1175.628.5All Other(97.9)(74.8)(23.1)(241.2)(178.2)(63.0)Total Operating Earnings (non-GAAP)923.8831.092.82,077.62,065.112.5A full reconciliation of GAAP earnings with operating earnings is included in tables at the end of this news release.a.Includes AEP Generating Co., Appalachian Power, Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Kingsport Power, Public Service Co. of Oklahoma, Southwestern Electric Power and Wheeling Powerb.Includes Ohio Power and AEP Texasc.Includes wholly-owned transmission-only subsidiaries and transmission-only joint venturesd.Includes AEP OnSite Partners, AEP Renewables, competitive generation in ERCOT and PJM as well as marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM and MISO\xa0EARNINGS GUIDANCEAEP management narrowed its 2023 operating earnings guidance range to $5.24 to $5.34 per share. Operating earnings could differ from GAAP earnings for matters such as impairments, divestitures or changes in accounting principles.

Therefore, AEP is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for 2023 earnings guidance.Reflecting special items recorded through the third quarter, the estimated earnings per share on a GAAP basis would be $4.84 to $4.94 per share.

AEP uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding its earnings outlook and results. The company uses operating earnings data internally to measure performance against budget, to report to AEP\'s Board of Directors and also as an input in determining performance-based compensation under the company\'s employee incentive compensation plans.At American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, we understand that our customers and communities depend on safe, reliable and affordable power. Our nearly 17,000 employees operate and maintain more than 40,000 miles of transmission lines, the nation\'s largest electric transmission system, and more than 225,000 miles of distribution lines to deliver power to 5.6 million customers in 11 states. AEP also is one of the nation\'s largest electricity producers with nearly 29,000 megawatts of diverse generating capacity, including approximately 6,100 megawatts of renewable energy. AEP is investing $40 billion over the next five years to make the electric grid cleaner and more reliable. We are on track to reach an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 and have a goal to achieve net zero by 2045.

Although AEP and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries believe that their expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, any such statements may be influenced by factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changes in economic conditions, electric market demand and demographic patterns in AEP service territories; the impact of pandemics and any associated disruption of AEP\'s business operations due to impacts on economic or market conditions, costs of compliance with potential government regulations, electricity usage, supply chain issues, customers, service providers, vendors and suppliers; the economic impact of increased global trade tensions including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the adoption or expansion of economic sanctions or trade restrictions; inflationary or deflationary interest rate trends; volatility and disruptions in the financial markets precipitated by any cause, including failure to make progress on federal budget or debt ceiling matters, particularly developments affecting the availability or cost of capital to finance new capital projects and refinance existing debt; the availability and cost of funds to finance working capital and capital needs, particularly if expected sources of capital, such as proceeds from the sale of assets or subsidiaries, do not materialize, and during periods when the time lag between incurring costs and recovery is long and the costs are material; decreased demand for electricity; weather conditions, including storms and drought conditions, and AEP\'s ability to recover significant storm restoration costs; limitations or restrictions on the amounts and types of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with natural disasters or operations; the cost of fuel and its transportation, the creditworthiness and performance of fuel suppliers and transporters and the cost of storing and disposing of used fuel, including coal ash and spent nuclear fuel; the availability of fuel and necessary generation capacity and the performance of generation plants; AEP\'s ability to recover fuel and other energy costs through regulated or competitive electric rates; the ability to transition from fossil generation and the ability to build or acquire renewable generation, transmission lines and facilities (including the ability to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals and permits) when needed at acceptable prices and terms, including favorable tax treatment, and to recover those costs; new legislation, litigation and government regulation, including changes to tax laws and regulations, oversight of nuclear generation, energy commodity trading and new or heightened requirements for reduced emissions of sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, carbon, soot or particulate matter and other substances that could impact the continued operation, cost recovery, and/or profitability of generation plants and related assets; the impact of federal tax legislation on results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or credit ratings; the risks associated with fuels used before, during and after the generation of electricity and the byproducts and wastes of such fuels, including coal ash and spent nuclear fuel; timing and resolution of pending and future rate cases, negotiations and other regulatory decisions, including rate or other recovery of new investments in generation, distribution and transmission service and environmental compliance; resolution of litigation or regulatory proceedings or investigations; AEP\'s ability to constrain operation and maintenance costs; prices and demand for power generated and sold at wholesale; changes in technology, particularly with respect to energy storage and new, developing, alternative or distributed sources of generation; AEP\'s ability to recover through rates any remaining unrecovered investment in generation units that may be retired before the end of their previously projected useful lives; volatility and changes in markets for coal and other energy-related commodities, particularly changes in the price of natural gas; the impact of changing expectations and demands of customers, regulators, investors and stakeholders, including heightened emphasis on environmental, social and governance concerns; changes in utility regulation and the allocation of costs within regional transmission organizations, including ERCOT, PJM and SPP; changes in the creditworthiness of the counterparties with contractual arrangements, including participants in the energy trading market; actions of rating agencies, including changes in the ratings of debt; the impact of volatility in the capital markets on the value of the investments held by AEP\'s pension, other postretirement benefit plans, captive insurance entity and nuclear decommissioning trust and the impact of such volatility on future funding requirements; accounting standards periodically issued by accounting standard-setting bodies; other risks and unforeseen events, including wars and military conflicts, the effects of terrorism (including increased security costs), embargoes, wildfires, cyber security threats and other catastrophic events; and the ability to attract and retain the requisite work force and key personnel.American Electric PowerFinancial Results for the Third Quarter of 2023Reconciliation of GAAP to Operating Earnings (non-GAAP)2023Vertically Integrated

Year to date the ETF is down a whopping 21%.Much of the damage on the normally ""safe-haven"" area of the market has to do with higher rates.Stocks for companies that range from electricity providers to water suppliers normally offer dividends. But those payouts don’t look as appealing to investors when compared to soaring bond yields in a tight monetary policy environment. On Tuesday, the two-year Treasury note hovered around 5.15% while the 10-year touched 4.79%.“Many utilities currently offer forward yields near 5%. However, when investors can obtain risk-free Treasuries offering yields between 4.5% to 5.5%, depending on the maturity, the risk-reward trade off for holding utilities is much less attractive, “ equity analyst Daniel Rich at CFRA Research told Yahoo Finance.Jim Shandalov, vice president at NextEra Energy Resources, California Governor Gavin Newsom (R), and former Mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa (C) walk along the construction of the battery storage facility for a solar farm. (John G. Mabanglo-Pool/Getty Images)Additionally, the Federal Reserve\'s interest rate mantra of ""higher for longer"" also means the cost of capital will stay elevated, another reason why the sector sold off aggressively last quarter. The market expects investments for new power plants, aging infrastructures, and renewable technologies will cost more.Utility stocks were already in a downward trend since the start of the year as investors rotated into growth names. But the selling intensified last week when NextEra Energy Partners (NEP), a subsidiary of NextEra Energy (NEE) focused on renewables, cut its growth target by half to 6%, through at least 2026.""Tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates obviously affect the financing needed to grow distributions at 12%,"" read the company statement. Some of the worst performers in the utility sector year to date include NextEra Energy, AES Corp (AES), and Eversource Energy (ES), down 52%, 37%, and 33% respectively.Story continues""While the sector is very out of favor, we think the sell-off presents some attractive buying opportunities for names with competitive earnings and dividend growth potential,"" said CFRA\'s Rich.""Among some of the larger names, we maintain Buy opinions on NextEra, Duke Energy (DUK), and American Electric Power (AEP),"" he added.Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Companies categorized as dividend aristocrats have a decades-long history of periodically distributing dividends, making them a good source of income during turbulent market conditions and recessionary fears.Buffett, who currently ranks No. 5 on the Forbes real-time billionaires list with a net worth of $114 billion, is a stalwart supporter of industry-leading blue chip stocks.""Beware the investment activity that produces applause; the great moves are usually greeted by yawns,"" Buffett once said.Don\'t Miss:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup.Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth before he floods it with new tech workers.Take a look at some of Buffett\'s most trustworthy dividend-paying stocks.Coca-Cola Co.Buffett has said dividend stocks are the ""secret sauce"" behind Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\'s success. He called out the Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) in Berkshire Hathaway\'s 2022 shareholder letter, stating, ""[Dividend] growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays.""Buffett and his right-hand man Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, invested $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola, obtaining 400 million shares in 1994 when it generated a dividend income of $75 million. As of 2022, annual dividends from Coca-Cola shares have catapulted to $704 million — a more than 800% rise in less than three decades.Story continuesBerkshire Hathaway\'s stake in Coca-Cola was valued at $25 billion as of 2022, marking a more than 1,800% rise from the initial investment of $1.3 billion. As of last year, Coca-Cola stock accounted for approximately 5% of Berkshire Hathaway\'s total holdings.American Express Co.Buffett made similar gains from his investment in American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP). He invested nearly $1.3 billion in American Express in 1995, which is now valued at $22 billion. This marks a nearly 1,600% rise in valuation.Capital gains are not the only benefit American Express stock has generated for Buffett. The world\'s largest portfolio manager also pocketed dividend income of $302 million from his American Express holdings in 2022, up from $41 million during the initial investment in 1995.""Those [American Express dividend] checks, too, seem highly likely to increase,"" Buffett said in Berkshire Hathaway\'s 2022 shareholder letter. American Express shares also account for nearly 5% of Hathaway\'s net worth.Apple Inc.While Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not considered a dividend stock by most investors, the tech giant\'s dividend payouts have made the stock one of Buffett\'s family jewels. Berkshire Hathaway holds a nearly 5.8% stake in Apple.Buffett describes Apple as a ""better business than any we own."" He credits his substantial stake in Apple to multiple share repurchases executed by the company over the years, making it ""costless"" for Berkshire Hathaway to increase its Apple stock holdings.Buffett\'s dividend income from Apple averaged about $775 million annually as of 2020, according to Berkshire Hathaway\'s 2020 shareholder letter. Apple currently has 11 consecutive years of dividend growth history.Earn Money While You Sleep: Warren Buffett famously said, ""If you don\'t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.""

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 65% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of American Express. See our latest analysis for American Express ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.American Express already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of American Express, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in American Express. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 21% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.5% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.2% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 11 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of American Express Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$145m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in American Express. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 21% of American Express stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand American Express better, we need to consider many other factors.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

To skip reading Warren Buffett\'s investment strategy and Q2 bets of Berkshire Hathaway, go directly to the 5 Best Warren Buffett Stock Picks for Beginners.The Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, might not be the wealthiest man in the world, but he’s arguably the most successful investor of our time. However, Warren Buffett does not consider money the greatest investment tool. He once said:“The best investment by far is anything that develops yourself, and it\'s not taxed at all.”What Beginners Can Learn From BuffettStock picks for beginners can be challenging. However, taking lessons from Warren Buffett’s life and investment strategy is valuable for beginners and experts alike. One of the best lessons beginners can learn from Buffett is how to spend money. Despite being one of the richest men in the world, he lives a very simple life. While many people spend money on luxuries such as cars and massive houses, Buffett has only changed three cars in the last two decades. He changed his Lincoln Town Car for a 2006 Cadillac DTS after almost a decade and then replaced his DTS with his current car, the 2014 Cadillac XTS. His frugality means that he now has enough money to buy anything he wants at a whim. Buffett says:""I have everything in life I want; it\'s a very simple thing. If there\'s anything that money could buy that I wanted, I would do it this afternoon without hesitation.""From an investment point of view, one of the first things that beginners can learn from Buffett is to invest in businesses instead of stocks. It means that an investor should pick a business they understand. It will help the investor understand how the business is going and how it will possibly perform in the future.Moreover, Buffett’s most well-known investment strategy is long-term value investing. He chooses stocks with strong fundamentals based on their intrinsic value and keeps them for a long time. He says that a stock is not worth buying if you can\'t keep it for 10 years.Story continuesWarren Buffett is also against diversification. Diversification is not necessarily a bad thing for beginner investors who do not have much backup. Diversification can be beneficial because they won’t lose everything if one of the investments goes completely downhill. However, if Buffett\'s advice on investing in companies you understand is to be taken into consideration, investing in just a few businesses you know well can be rewarding. In the second quarter, 51% of Berkshire Hathaway was covered by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Buffett has held the stock for almost 7 years.Warren Buffett’s Bets in Q2 2023In the second quarter, Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F portfolio was worth $348 billion, up from $325 billion in the first quarter. Given that Buffett doesn’t like to diversify much, his top 10 holdings covered 91% of his 13F portfolio. Berkshire sold out of McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK), Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC), and Vitesse Energy, Inc. (NYSE:VTS). He further bought 3 new stocks, increased holdings in 2, and reduced holdings in 5.One company that Warren Buffett is constantly increasing his holdings in is Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY). Buffett started buying the company shares in 2022 when the oil prices were hitting their all-time highs due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Buffett now owns nearly 26% of the company. However, he mentioned that he is not looking to control the company because he thinks that the company is already in good hands. Despite the recent fluctuations in the oil and gas market, Buffett is still not bearish on the sector. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) are two of the top ten stocks held by Berkshire Hathaway.According to Tipranks, Berkshire Hathaway has gained 98.31% in the last decade and the 3-year annualized return of the hedge fund is around 8.5%.

Names like Expedia (EXPE), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Delta Air Lines. These companies have strong returns on capital (14%+), good competitive positions, cheap valuations (all double-digit free cash flow yields), and are returning capital to shareholders.

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts. Up through the bear market came a “bubblin’ crude!”11. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Percentage of Warren Buffett’s Stock Portfolio: 5.56%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a California-based company that explores, produces, refines, and distributes oil and gas.

(NYSE:C) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“We’ve recently been adding to Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C). After perennially disappointing for decades, even the most bullish financial investors aren’t interested (a good thing in our view!). CEO Jane Fraser is making all the right moves: exiting underperforming consumer businesses, investing to improve the tech and operating infrastructure, returning capital to shareholders. These actions should result in improving returns on equity. The market reaction is a giant shrug.We should start to see serious cost improvements in late 2024 accompanied by improving returns on equity. The stock trades at ~$46, 55% of its $85 tangible book value. The company is confident it can reach 11-12% return on tangible common equity by 2025 when it’s tangible book should be greater than $100. If it reaches its return target, as we believe, Citi should trade back to tangible book, implying a more than double over the next couple years.

(NASDAQ:TMUS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“During the quarter we initiated positions in two new names: T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Gilead Sciences. T-Mobile is the best-in-class player in the wireless space, delivering the strongest growth with the lowest cost structure and the best consumer proposition. T-Mobile’s strength is rooted in its advantaged competitive position. Its superior spectrum holdings enable it to provide better wireless service at meaningfully lower cost. T-Mobile’s annual capital expenditures run about $10 billion, on the order of half the amount its peers must spend. Due to its lower cost structure, T-Mobile can undercut its competitors on price while still generating compelling profitability and returns.This combination — superior service at lower prices — has enabled T-Mobile to outgrow its competition. In the three years since completing its merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has grown its post-paid subscriber base by about 22%. Over the same period, AT&T’s has grown by about 14%, while Verizon’s by less than 5%.Given the high fixed-cost nature of the wireless business, these steady increases in revenue growth have led to outsize increases in profits and free cash flow. Free cash flow in 2023 is expected to come in around $13.5 billion, up from less than $8 billion last year. In 2024 free cash flow is expected to grow by over 20% to approximately $17 billion — providing a 10% yield based on today’s stock price.We have long admired T-Mobile, but until recently the stock did not pay a dividend. The company announced its inaugural dividend in September, and we bought the stock shortly thereafter. The initial yield is about 2% and it is expected to grow about 10% per year.”6.

Buffett has consistently prioritized a deep understanding of a company's inner workings before making an investment. His investment strategy revolves around identifying businesses with robust and scalable models, poised for expansion and market dominance, ultimately benefiting from the resulting increase in stock value. Buffett ranks among the highest-earning hedge fund managers, thanks to the consistent returns his investments have historically yielded through Berkshire Hathaway. The renowned investor possesses a remarkable track record with his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, which has delivered an annualized return of 19.8% from 1965 to 2022. This figure is nearly double the 9.9% annualized return of the S&P 500. Lately, the billionaire has emerged as one of the most proactive hedge fund managers, capitalizing on the high-interest rate environment. Bolstered by a substantial cash reserve of $147 billion at the close of June, the iconic investor has been actively seeking out investments capable of delivering significant returns, particularly with short-term rates exceeding 5%. To illustrate, he started betting on the housing market during the June quarter, acquiring stakes in three construction companies. These include NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI).On the other hand, however, the investor has started shifting his perspective on the banking sector. Starting from 2020, the 'Oracle of Omaha' has divested from several financial institutions that have experienced significant declines this year: Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) (-5%), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) (-14%), M&T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) (-23%), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) (-28%), and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) (-30%). As of the end of June, the market value of Berkshire's holdings in banking, financial, and insurance stocks stood at $67 billion, with an initial cost base of $24 billion. This segment of the conglomerate's stock portfolio was valued at $102 billion with a $40 billion cost base at the close of 2019. Notably, it comprised only 19% of Berkshire's total portfolio value in June, a substantial drop from 41%, highlighting the extent of Berkshire's divestitures during this period.Story continuesBuffett's shift in stance on banks emerged in April when he expressed concern that some banks were inflating their earnings and misleading investors by valuing their assets at historical cost instead of their current market value. He also criticized them for mismanaging their assets and liabilities, such as using immediately withdrawable customer deposits to acquire long-term bonds. It's important to note that Buffett and his team haven't completely abandoned investments in banks, and they have not been immune to the challenges faced this year. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) remains Berkshire's second-largest holding after Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though its stock has experienced a 23% decline since the beginning of the year.With these details in mind, we'll be looking at some stocks that are favored by Warren Buffett as long-term stock options.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), among others listed below.Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According To Warren BuffettOur MethodologyIn order to compile our selection of the best long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett, we began by analyzing the billionaire's stock portfolio and chose to highlight the stock holdings that have remained within his portfolio for at least 5 years.

(NYSE:KR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter.\xa0Here\xa0is what the firm has to say:“The Kroger Co.\xa0(NYSE:KR) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery. However, we believe the company’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return approximately 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”9.

The S&P 500 is down over 3.4%. And even the blue-chip Dow stocks are down 1.89%. Nevertheless, if you’re looking to be a contrarian investor, it’s a good time to look for undervalued long-term stocks.You may not find them in the tech sector, but there are no shortages of choices for investors who know what they’re looking for. For some investors that may mean technical signals like the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI). Others may look at fundamental signals like a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. It may be a tough time to buy stocks, but investors who are in it for the long haul know that these pullbacks create future opportunities. Price is price, but value is value. And that’s why you should consider these undervalued long-term stocks to help finish out the year. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCrown Holdings (CCK)In this photo illustration Crown Holdings, Inc. (CCK) logo seen displayed on a smartphone in the background.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comUndervalued long-term stocks aren’t always found in the tech sector. Case in point is Crown Holdings (NYSE:CCK). The company used to be known as Cork, Crown & Seal makes packaging products for the beverage industry. The company’s aluminum products promote sustainability and the circular economy.Crown reported earnings on Oct. 24. The results were mixed with a miss on revenue and earnings that came in line with estimates. However, earnings were almost 20% higher on a year-over-year (YoY) basis. And in the next 12 months, earnings are expected to grow by another 16%.CCK stock is up 17% in the last 12 months, but the recent market sell-off has pushed the stock negative for 2023. That looks like an opportunity for investors to buy a stock that is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12x. In October 2023, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for CCK hit 30 which is considered an Oversold indicator on three separate occasions. In each case, the stock bounced higher which indicates that there’s plenty of support from bargain hunters who are looking to add to their positions. Story continuesGenerac (GNRC)Generac GP7500E 7500-Watt Gasoline during Fundraising Event in Olney, MDSource: Lissandra Melo / Shutterstock.comThe key word in a bullish argument for Generac (NYSE:GNRC) is long-term. The stock is down over 16% in 2023 and in any time period you look at, the stock continues to fall. The reason is simple enough, revenue and earnings are down YoY. It’s understandable as the housing market continues to be weak and a relatively calm hurricane season means that a backup power system is likely not top of mind for consumers in the company’s target market. But it also makes it hard to justify a stock that has a premium valuation at over 34x earnings. But I can’t help noticing that earnings are expected to increase by 35% in the next 12 months. If that takes place, the stock could begin to justify a lower 15x forward valuation. Investors will get their first signal as to whether Generac can hit those numbers when it reports earnings on November 1, 2023. GNRC stock has sliced through both its 50- and 200-day simple moving averages. It’s starting to look like a falling knife, but…the RSI for GNRC stock is around 19 as of this writing. That suggests that investors may be overcorrecting on the stock. Pfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comRecent revenue and earnings numbers make a strong case that support the recent price activity with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock. Shares are trading near 2020 lows as revenue and earnings are down sharply YoY.The driving factor is declining sales for its Covid-19 products. However, while the company is losing the outsized revenue and earnings from those products, it’s not losing revenue from them altogether. More importantly, as Alex Sirois recently noted, Pfizer has used the cash it generated during the pandemic to develop its pipeline. The company has over a dozen drugs that could hit the market in the next 18 months. That doesn’t account for its proposed acquisition of Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN) that will add even more candidates to its oncology portfolio.And Pfizer is also rewarding shareholders with a dividend that has increased for 12 consecutive years and currently has a 5.25% yield. PFE stock currently trades at 8x earnings. However, earnings are expected to increase 95% in the next 12 months, which means the stock may not be undervalued for long. \xa0 American Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comI recently put American Express (NYSE:AXP) on a list of stocks to sell. At that time, however, I acknowledged the bullish case for the stock. Specifically, Amex targets high net-worth individuals who have much lower delinquency rates. That adds a defensive characteristic to a business model that frequently comes under pressure at times of economic weakness. My short-term concern is that overall spending could be curtailed in the short-term. Despite two consecutive quarters in which the company beat on the top and bottom lines, AXP stock can’t seem to catch a bid. But, with the stock trading down 14% in the last three months ending Oct. 26, it’s trading at a level investors haven’t seen in about 18 months. And at 12x forward earnings, it’s valued inexpensively to the broader market. \xa0If you have time on your side, that makes the stock pretty compelling as one of the undervalued long-term stocks for your portfolio.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) makes this list of undervalued long-term stocks for a couple of reasons. First, MDT stock is trading near its 52-week low. Second, the stock also has an RSI of around 25 as of this writing. So the technical case is there.What about the fundamentals? Medtronic trades at 26 times trailing earnings, but only about 13x forward earnings. This suggests that MDT is a stock in need of a catalyst. The company doesn’t report earnings, but when it does, investors will want to hear more about its Aurora EV-ICD MRI SureScan system. This first-of-its-kind product recently received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating dangerously fast heart rhythms that may lead to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Medtronic has beat on the top and bottom lines in its last two earnings report. But the stock is down 21% in that time. Perhaps the third time will be the charm for MDT stock. In the meantime, investors get a solid dividend that pays a 3.92% yield. Plus, the dividend aristocrat has increased its dividend for 47 consecutive years. Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAny list of undervalued long-term stocks to buy in October 2023 needs to include at least one energy stock. Recently Warren Buffett added to his position in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) so it’s a logical choice to include.This isn’t the first time that Buffett has bought OXY stock in 2023. In fact, it’s the third time he’s bought the stock and his hedge fund Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) now holds over 25% of the company’s shares. One reason that Buffett prefers Occidental is the company’s exposure to the Permian basin. This region accounts for 40% of U.S. oil production, and Buffett believes there’s more growth to come from this area.Admittedly, retail investors can’t get the 8% dividend yield that Buffett gets from his preferred shares. Nevertheless, the current dividend only accounts for about 10% of the company’s earnings per share (EPS). And if earnings expand as projected, the dividend is likely to move much higher. \xa0 Dollar General (DG)The front of a Dollar General (DG Stock) store on a sunny day.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comThe latest reading on retail sales shows that even dollar stores are struggling with the effects of inflation. Dollar General (NYSE:DG) is one of the leaders in the sector, but the retail chain is forecasting slower sales as consumers continue to stick to the staple items. The discount model relies on the idea that low prices on staple items will allow consumers to buy more at the store. That’s not materializing, and DG stock is down 50% in 2023. But there’s a bright spot. The stock is up about 14% in the month ending October 26, 2023. Some of that is due to the return of the company’s former CEO, Todd Vasos. That won’t be enough to sustain the DG stock price growth if the company can’t get its arms around problems such as slumping same-store sales and retail theft. However, the stock looks like it could break above its 50-day moving average. That still keeps it well south of its 200-day SMA, but it could give DG stock momentum heading into the holiday season.

AIG,"[""AIGInsider Monkey TranscriptsNovember 3, 2023 at 1:40 PM·29 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowAIGAmerican International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript November 2, 2023Operator: Good day, and welcome to AIG's Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. This conference is being recorded. Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.Quentin McMillan: Thanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also include non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.Additionally, note that today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and other operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG's segments and US GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect, thereto, differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Friday, November 3rd. Finally, please note that today's remarks as they relate to net premiums written in general insurance are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis adjusted for the international lag elimination and the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re. Please refer to the footnote on page 26 of the third quarter financial supplement for prior period results for Crop Risk Services and Validus Re. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.Story continuesPeter Zaffino: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. In the third quarter, AIG continued to deliver exceptional results. We made significant progress in our strategic, operational and financial objectives, reflecting continued execution across our entire organization. During my remarks this morning, I will discuss the following topics; first, AIG's financial results, including life and retirement and provide an update on recent divestitures; second, I will provide the results of AIG's general insurance business; third, I will provide an update on the casualty insurance market more broadly and AIG's approach to our casualty portfolio; fourth, I will provide an update on our capital management strategy and the progress we have made this quarter.Sabra will provide more detail on AIG's balance sheet and capital position in her remarks. And lastly, I will reconfirm our guidance with respect to our path to a 10% plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. Financial highlights from the third quarter included; adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.61 per diluted common share, representing a 92% increase year-over-year. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pre-tax income basis was $3.3 billion, a 29% increase year-over-year. In general insurance, net investment income was $756 million, a 30% increase. Net premiums written in General Insurance grew 9% and General Insurance underwriting income in the quarter was $611 million, which improved over 250% from the prior year quarter.The adjusted accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 86.3%, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter, which is an outstanding result. Our cat loss ratio was 6.9% with $462 million of total catastrophe losses, including reinstatement premiums, which included $70 million from Validus Re. We had favorable prior year reserve development of $139 million, reflecting favorable loss experience on our portfolio, resulting from our continued focus on underwriting discipline. The Life and Retirement business also delivered strong results in the third quarter with continued sales momentum and spread expansion. Life and Retirement's adjusted pre-tax income was $971 million, up 24% year-over-year. Premiums and deposits grew 4% year-over-year to $9.2 billion driven by strong fixed indexed annuity sales, which exceeded $2 billion for the third consecutive quarter.September marked the one-year anniversary of Corebridge's initial public offering. And since the IPO, Corebridge has returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders and is well on track to its committed payout ratio. With respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge, we continue to evaluate options that are aligned with the best interest of shareholders and our other stakeholders. We're very proud of the achievements that Corebridge has delivered towards its operational separation as a public company, and we remain committed to reducing our ownership and eventually a full separation. Turning to AIG's balance sheet. During the quarter, AIG returned over $1 billion to shareholders through $785 million of common stock repurchases and $261 million of dividends.In addition, we purchased $170 million of common stock in October. We deployed $289 million to retire Validus Re debt prior to the close of the transaction yesterday and we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion of parent liquidity. During the quarter, we continue to make significant progress on our strategic repositioning as we have further simplified our portfolio, which we've talked about over the past several quarters. Yesterday, we announced the successful closing of the sale of Validus Re to Renaissance Re for which we received a total consideration of $3.3 billion in cash, including a pre-closed dividend and approximately $275 million at RenaissanceRe common stock. This divestiture streamlines our business model, simplifies our portfolio and further reduces our volatility.Prior to closing the Validus Re transaction, we entered into an agreement with Enstar Group to provide AIG with protection against any adverse development on the 95% portion of Validus Re's loss reserves that AIG retains exposure to. The cost will be included in the gain on sale in the fourth quarter. Enstar will provide $400 million of limit for an adverse development cover in excess of carried loss reserves on assumed reinsurance contracts underwritten by Validus Re with respect to accident year 2022 and prior. This ADC limit provides additional protection against downside exposure to reserves in excess of the expected redundancy to a modeled confidence level above the 90th percentile. Importantly, while we believe this ADC is prudent to mitigate the risk of any future adverse reserve development, we will benefit from any future favorable reserve development.In August, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell Laya Healthcare to AXA for $650 million, which calls on October 31st. Proceeds to Corebridge net of purchase price adjustments and deal-related expenses will be approximately $730 million. It was announced that the proceeds will be used for a special dividend to Corebridge shareholders as of November 13th. In September, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell the UK life insurance business to Aviva plc for £460 million. We expect the transaction to close sometime in the second quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals. We anticipate that the proceeds from this transaction will largely be used for share repurchases, subject to market conditions. Both transactions streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow the company to focus on its life retirement products and solutions in the United States.Turning to General Insurance. Gross premiums written were $8.9 billion, a decrease of 1% from prior year quarter. Net premiums written were $6.5 billion, an increase of 9% from the prior year quarter. Global Commercial grew 6% and Global Personnel grew 16% from the prior year quarter. North America commercial net premiums written increased 5% in the third quarter. There are many variables in this quarter, and I want to provide more detail. The key businesses that drove growth were Lexington's core business, excluding Lexington programs, grew over 25% in the quarter, led by wholesale casualty, which grew 33% and wholesale property, which grew 27%. Glatfelter grew 12% and retail property grew 11%. In terms of headwinds in 2022, we made the underwriting decision to not renew two large Lexington programs.We took this action because we believe that these programs had meaningful CAT exposure in peak zones. And we do not believe the appropriate CAT loads were reflected in the pricing. These programs were not the best deployment of capital in order to achieve our targeted risk-adjusted returns. Those nonrenewals tempered overall growth in Lexington. Lexington program's net premiums written reduced by 57% in the quarter. We believe, over time, we will replace this business on an individual risk basis as stronger risk-adjusted returns. However, it is a headwind in the quarter. The impact of the net premiums written associated with these 2 programs was approximately $115 million in the third quarter. Also offsetting growth in North America was financial lines, which declined 11% accounting for approximately 20% of North America Commercial Lines net premiums written in the quarter.In North America Financial Lines, large account public D&O remains competitive, as a result of excess capacity driven by new entrants to the market. Our renewal retention in our primary business remains strong, but retentions in our excess business were more challenged. New business in our excess book was down year-over-year as we were very disciplined in the current environment. Rate reductions remain most prevalent on excess layers, particularly the higher excess layer vertical towers, where it's more commoditized and the most pressure exists on pricing and primary, where we are one of the few market leaders, rates remain flat to slightly down. We remain confident in our approach to financial lines, We have a global business with scale focused on underwriting profit over top line growth, which is reflected in the results this quarter.In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 7%, primarily driven by property, which was up 13%; Global Specialty, which was up 12%, led by Energy & Marine; and Talbot, which was up 7%. Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 87% in its in-force portfolio. North America was up 200 basis points to 87% and international was up 300 basis points to 88%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. And across Global Commercial, we continue to see very strong new business, which was approximately $1 billion in the third quarter. North America Commercial produced new business of $516 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year or 27% if you exclude financial lines. This growth was driven by Lexington Casualty, which saw excellent new business growth of over 90% as well as Western World, which grew over 50%.Retail Property grew new business by 26% and retail casualty grew new business by 25%. This was offset by financial lines, where new business contracted by about 30% as a result of our underwriting discipline. International Commercial produced new business of $532 million or 12% growth year-over-year. This growth was led by Talbot new business, which increased almost 50% year-over-year and Global Specialty, which grew new business by over 40%, and it was balanced across the portfolio. Moving to rate. In North America Commercial, rate increased 5.4% in the third quarter or 6% excluding workers' compensation. Exposure in the quarter added 3 points, bringing the total pricing change, excluding workers' comp to 9%. Rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 15%, marking the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases, led by Lexington wholesale property, which was up 28%, Retail property was up 27% and admitted excess casualty was up 12%.Financial Lines rate was down 8%. In International Commercial, rate increased 4% and the exposure increase was 2%. The rate increase was driven by property, which was up 13%; energy, which was up 10%; and Talbot, which was up 9%. Turning to Personal Insurance. Net premiums written increased 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by North America. In North America, personal net premiums written increased 59%, similar to last quarter, the increase was driven by business underwritten on behalf of PCS, offset by decreases in travel and warranty. In the third quarter, AIG's net premiums written from PCS increased by over 100%, benefiting from an increase in gross premiums written and a reduction in quota share sessions. And as expected, the lag and earned premium growth continued to dissipate providing operating leverage and a reduced expense ratio primarily in general operating expenses.The high and ultra high net worth business also had significant improvement in the accident year loss ratio, benefiting from improved pricing in our admitted business and transitioning more business to the non-admitted market. We expect PCS to continue to improve its financial performance and provide more operating leverage in the fourth quarter and into 2024. In International personal, net premiums written increased by 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in personal auto, travel, and that reflects the rebound post pandemic and Japan personal property. The accident year loss ratio ex-CAT improved 560 basis points. Overall, we're pleased with the international personal improvement year-over-year. Shifting to combined ratios. The General Insurance third quarter combined ratio was 90.5%, a 680 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter.Accident year combined ratio ex cats was 86.3%, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. Global Commercial had an outstanding performance with third quarter accident year combined ratio ex-CAT of 81.7%, a 130 basis point improvement year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio, including CAT was 89.7%, a 500 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio ex-CAT was 83%, and the international commercial accident year combined ratio ex-CAT was 79.7%, both of which were exceptional outcomes. We would like to provide a perspective both with and without Validus Re in crop risk services. As I said, the third quarter global commercial accident year combined ratio ex CAT was 81.7%, and the calendar year combined ratio was 86.6%.Excluding Validus Re from the third quarter results, the global commercial accident year combined ratio would essentially have been flat and the calendar year combined ratio would have improved by slightly over 100 basis points from the third quarter to 85.4%. And for the first nine months, the global commercial accident year combined ratio ex CAT was 83.6% and the calendar year combined ratio was 87.6%. Excluding crop and Validus Re from the 9-month period results, the global commercial accident year combined ratio ex CAT would have increased by 70 basis points to 84.3% and the calendar year combined ratio would have increased by 50 basis points to 88.1%. Global Personal reported a third quarter accident year combined ratio ex cats of 99%, a 380 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter, due in part to the North America PCS business.Related to casualty liability and the excess casualty market, in particular in the United States, the level of narrative has increased over the last several years, driven in part by multiple mass tort events, as well as rising economic and social inflation. The latter has been fueled by an exponential increase in third-party litigation funding, average severity trend increases and a precipitous rise in jury awards following the lull during the pandemic. Over the past couple of years, I've spoken extensively about our portfolio remediation strategy, including where AIG has reduced gross limits since 2018 by $1.4 trillion. We have established strong underwriting guidelines and strong partnerships with reinsurers to manage both frequency and severity.We have filed a similar strategy with our casualty portfolio with more of a focus on severity. When we began the underwriting turnaround in AIG in 2017, we found that the prior strategy in Casualty was similar to that in the property business, which was to write large limits with a gross and net risk appetite much greater than what we offer today. As I've outlined before, it was not uncommon to put out significant limits on any individual risk in excess of $100 million net on an occurrence basis. As we developed an entirely new framework and approach to underwriting, it required a change to our underwriting strategy. Today, our global Casualty portfolio represents 12% and of our total gross premiums written and 13% of our net premiums rate.The North America segment represents 55% and the International segment represents 45% of that number. And since North America has been the topic of discussion, I will focus on what we have done in that portfolio. In North America Casualty, our gross limit for our excess casualty portfolio, including lead umbrella, has decreased by over 50% since 2018. Our average limit size has also reduced by over 50%. Average lead attachment points, which protect us from frequency and lower severity losses have more than doubled since 2018. In terms of gross pricing, primary auto and primary general liability rates have increased approximately 200% since 2018, and excess casualty rates have increased by over 250% remaining well above loss cost trends. In addition to the significant investment in underwriting excellence and talent, we built and executed on a strategic reinsurance program to further mitigate our net exposure and volatility.What once was $100 million net exposure for AIG, there's now a maximum net on any one claim of $15 million in international and $11.5 million in North America. And in our excess of loss treaties, we have reinstatement limits that exhaust based on extensive modeling done at the 1,000 return periods. This adequately protects AIG from vertical exposure with significant limit available in the event there are multiple losses. Notably, the period prior to 2016 is covered by an adverse development cover for US long-tail commercial lines. We purchased 80% of a $25 billion -- excess of $25 billion on payments made on or after January 1, 2016, for business written prior to 2016. The $25 billion retention was exceeded during the fourth quarter of 2020.A professional advisor helping a client with an insurance policy, highlighting the company’s attention to customer service.We currently have $9 billion of the total unused recoverable limit left or $7.2 billion at the 80% level. Conflicting views have emerged in the market on the combination of gross portfolio underwriting with the strategic use of reinsurance. There have been comments particularly recently that the use of reinsurance is not required if you're comfortable with the gross portfolio. We disagree and simply don't support that as a viable strategy for AIG. We prefer to balance our approach and have developed a strong underwriting culture, which we have dramatically improved over the last five years, executing on the fundamentals of disciplined and consistent underwriting being very focused on preempting the evolving changes in the market and using reinsurance strategically to mitigate unpredictable outcomes, building long-term strategic relationships with our reinsurance partners for all of our reinsurance needs has been key to repositioning AIG.Insurers cannot reverse social and economic inflation. However, we are in control of how we predict and respond to the impact of these changes to the forward-looking landscape, including how we manage our underwriting through coverage provided, limits deployed, attachment points and pricing. Our business is not immune from social inflation, but we anticipated it early, and we took action. The consequence is that we're very pleased with our existing portfolio and we're well-positioned to be able to prudently take advantage of opportunities that exist in the current marketplace. Turning to capital management. We use a balanced framework that remains focused on having ample capital in our insurance company subsidiaries to support organic growth in our business, continuing share repurchases, debt reduction in line with the lower end of the targets we provided and dividend increases.Lastly, we will consider compelling inorganic growth opportunities to meet our strategic objectives should they emerge. We finished the third quarter with $3.6 billion of available liquidity prior to receiving the proceeds of the sale of Validus Re for the special dividend from the sale of Lea Healthcare. Together, they should contribute approximately another $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Our primary use of proceeds will be on share repurchases. We plan to accelerate our repurchase activity this quarter and as we enter 2024 and we expect to reduce debt outstanding to further strengthen the balance sheet. We remain mindful of our leverage as a key consideration with our accelerated share repurchases. We expect to execute on the current share repurchase authorization of $7.5 billion, which will reduce shares outstanding to close to 600 million shares subject to market conditions.Related to return on common equity, as we have outlined on our prior calls, we remain very focused on delivering a 10% plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. During the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress at all four components of our path to deliver on this commitment and how we are positioning AIG for the future. I want to provide a few observations. In the last 90 days, we've continued to improve our underwriting results on an accident year and calendar year basis. We made recent leadership changes in general insurance, which have effectively eliminated a management layer from the business, and we will continue this process throughout the organization in 2024. We have strengthened the capital position of insurance company subsidiaries to enable continued profitable growth.We've moved into the final stages of the operational separation for Core Bridge. We have announced and closed several divestitures and have repositioned the portfolio to support our strategy for the future. We have accelerated the progress we're making on our capital management strategy and have created a strong liquidity position. The catalyst to achieving our targets remains the deconsolidation of Corebridge. This will allow AIG to simplify its business, eliminate duplication by combining our general insurance business and our corporate functions, and create a leaner operating model for the future. Before I turn it over to Sabra, I'd like to add a few more details on the closing of the sale of Validus Re to RenaissanceRe. In January, of 2018, AIG announced it was acquiring Validus Holdings to position it for future growth and profitability improvement.Over the last several years, we reshaped Validus Re's portfolio by reducing the catastrophe exposure in certain US peak zones while diversifying the business significantly to develop a more balanced portfolio in both property and casualty reinsurance in order to improve profitability. Validus Re posted its first accident year combined ratio below 100% in 2022. And as we look back, we are grateful for the hard work determination and perseverance of the team to dramatically improve the quality of the portfolio, particularly year-to-date in 2023, and it's evident in its performance today. We are very proud of Validus Re's results and are pleased that the company acquiring Validus Re is RenaissanceRe. Through Kevin O'Donnell and his leadership team's terrific work, RenaissanceRe has become one of the world's most well-respected reinsurers.We are looking forward to continuing our strong partnership with RenaissanceRe, which will be further enhanced as we become an investor in RenRe's capital partner vehicles allowing us to benefit from their future performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra.Sabra Purtill: Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on AIG's third quarter, including general insurance reserves net investment income, life and retirement results and balance sheet and capital management. Adjusted after-tax income attributable to common shareholders this quarter was $1.2 billion, up 80% from 3Q '22 for an annualized adjusted ROCE of 8.5%. AATI per diluted share was $1.61, up 92%, reflecting the accretive impact of share repurchases over the last year. The earnings growth resulted from the 82% increase in general insurance adjusted pre-tax income to $1.4 billion, driven by top line growth, improved underwriting results and higher investment income. It's important to note that while Life and Retirement also had strong earnings, AIG's ownership of Corebridge decreased to 65.6% this quarter compared to 90.1% before the IPO.And therefore, our results include a lower percentage of their consolidated earnings than last year. In total, Corebridge contributed about $32 million to the $514 million increase in AIG's adjusted after-tax income. Turning to General Insurance. Peter summarized our underwriting results, but I want to cover prior year development and reserves in more detail. In the quarter, General insurers prior year development, net of reinsurance totaled $139 million favorable, including $41 million from the amortization of deferred gain on the adverse development cover. About $129 million, including the ADC gain resulted from the detailed valuation reviews, or DVRs, with the balance from other items like catastrophes. The DVRs covered $34.1 billion of loss reserves on a pre-ADC basis, about 70% of the total.The DVRs of particular note this quarter were for international Casualty and Financial Lines, North America Financial Lines and North America workers' compensation, which last year was completed in the second quarter. In total, North America had $154 million of favorable development, including $39 million from the ADC. International was $15 million unfavorable. Consistent with our prior comments, casualty, bodily injury, securities class actions and medical workers' comp trends have been and continue to be more favorable than our reserving assumptions. We believe that our changes in underwriting standards reduce limits, higher attachment points on primary limits, tightened terms and conditions and better risk selection are driving the improved experience, particularly in financial lines and casualty.Nevertheless, our philosophy is to react to bad news quickly and to allow time for favorable trends in recent accident years to mature, particularly given the impact of COVID on recent years. Therefore, this quarter's favorable development is generally from older accident years or from short tail lines like property or physical damage claims coming quickly. In financial lines, changes from the DVRs were immaterial. North America had modest adverse development on an older Lexington architect and engineers book, offset by favorability in Canada. UK financial lines had slight adverse development, reflecting emerged experience on older D&O and professional indemnity claims, partially offset by favorable experience in Europe and Japan. We also reviewed international casualty lines this quarter.Peter discussed our changes in underwriting limits and reinsurance on our global casualty book, I would add that we also evaluate economic and social inflation trends as well as our potential exposure to mass torts across the total book and hold reserves to address those items. This quarter, we had adverse development in UK and European Casualty principally from commercial auto in France and large loss experience on a few older claims in both the UK and Europe. Consistent with prior trends, the DVRs for workers' compensation were favorable both for years covered by the ADC and after. Finally, property lines and Personal Insurance had favorable development in both North America and international, while we had about $23 million of adverse development on prior year catastrophes.We will complete the balance of annual DVRs next quarter, which cover about $6 billion of reserves on a number of smaller lines. Net investment income also contributed to earnings growth in the quarter driven principally by higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans. The average new money yield on fixed maturities and loans was 5.88% this quarter, about 145 basis points above the yield on sales and maturities and it was about 130 and 150 basis points higher in General Insurance and Life and Retirement, respectively. Year-to-date, the total new money yield is about 202 basis points higher than sales and maturities. The portfolio yield in general insurance increased nine basis points sequentially and 88 basis points over the last year with net investment income growth at 30%.The L&R investment income rose 23% and the portfolio yield improved nine basis points and 63 basis points, respectively. Based on the current treasury yield curve, we expect continued pickup in portfolio yields particularly in LNR, given the longer duration of its portfolio. Alternative investment income totaled $26 million for an annualized return of about 1%, better than the losses last year but below our long-term experience and outlook and down sequentially. Private equity returns are the principal driver of sequential decline in alternative returns this year as we have reduced our exposure to hedge funds over the last year. Private equity is reported on a one-quarter lag based on when we receive the fund's financial reports. So this quarter's financial results reflect second quarter markets.Our investment portfolios have strong credit performance and remain well diversified and highly rated. We continue to monitor commercial real estate closely. Debt service coverage ratios are strong, including in the office sector. The primary impact has been on loan-to-value ratios and real estate equity valuations rather than delinquencies or defaults. We continue to work on near-term maturities and almost all 2023 scheduled maturities have been addressed. Life and Retirement once again delivered strong results in the third quarter. Adjusted pre-tax income was $971 million, up 24% year-over-year driven by continued investment spread expansion and strong sales, particularly in fixed index annuities. Underwriting margins overall remain attractive and on a sequential quarter basis, fee income and investment spreads improved.During the quarter, the annual actuarial assumptions update was completed, resulting in a modest $22 million increase in APTI, mostly in the Life Insurance segment compared to a $29 million increase last year. Individual Retirement APTI increased $195 million or 52% over the prior year quarter from base spread expansion and general account product growth. The fixed annuity surrender rate increased sequentially from 15.9% to 17.7% this quarter as operations caught up on a backlog of surrender requests from earlier in the year. On a monthly basis, surrenders peaked early in the quarter and declined sequentially each month with continued improvement in October. Group Retirement APTI was flat year-over-year as higher fee income and alternative investment income were offset by lower other yield enhancement income and higher general operating expenses or GE.Net outflows included one large $1 billion plan, which was mostly in mutual funds and therefore, was not material to earnings. Life Insurance APT was also flat year-over-year, primarily due to lower policy fees and a lower favorable impact from the annual assumptions update, partially offset by higher net investment income. Institutional Markets APTI decreased $8 million or 10% and due to less favorable mortality experience. Sales increased 19%, supported by record production of $1.9 billion, partially offset by lower PRT sales, which are highly variable quarter-to-quarter. Turning to other operations. Third quarter adjusted pre-tax loss improved by $149 million, driven by lower corporate and other GOE and higher short-term investment income.In addition, third quarter 2022 had investment losses on a legacy portfolio that was sold in 4Q 2022. Corporate GOE was $243 million and included $68 million for Corebridge. Excluding Corebridge, AIG corporate GOE decreased $56 million from the prior year. We remain on track to reduce 2023 corporate GOE by at least $100 million, including a higher allocation to general insurance that has not had a material impact on the expense ratio due to expense discipline across the company. Moving to the balance sheet. Third quarter 2023 estimated risk-based capital ratios remain above our target ranges. The general insurance US pool RBC is in the high 400s, while Life and Retirement is above its 400% target. At September 30, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 25.9%, including $9.4 billion of coverage debt.Our approach to capital management is unchanged. We will continue to balance share repurchases and debt reduction, while also focusing on increasing common stock dividends. As Peter indicated, from the Validus and Lea sales, we expect about $3.7 billion of additional parent liquidity in the fourth quarter. We have significant financial flexibility, which we intend to use for both additional share repurchases and debt reduction. Based on current average daily trading volumes, we expect to be able to repurchase about $1.5 billion of common stock a quarter or $500 million a month, which we will begin when the market window opens after earnings. We expect to continue at this rate into 2024, depending on excess parent liquidity levels, including future core bridge sales proceeds and general insurance dividends.In the fourth quarter, we also plan to accelerate debt repayment to rightsize our debt stock for our target deconsolidated leverage ratio. Turning to our ROCE target. We remain laser focused and are making progress on achieving a 10% plus ROCE post deconsolidation. Year-to-date, annualized adjusted ROCE for AIG was 8.8% and 12.0% in General Insurance and 11.4% in Life and Retirement. Last quarter, I provided a pro forma AIG shareholders' equity ex-AOCI, excluding Corbridge, of about $40 billion, including deferred tax assets from the financial crisis net operating losses. That's the capital supporting our general insurance business and parent operations today, excluding our stake in Corbridge. With the sale of Validus Re and the redeployment of proceeds into share repurchases and debt reduction, the current pro forma estimate of AIG equity, excluding Core Bridge, is about $37 billion, including $4 billion of deferred tax assets or $33 billion of adjusted shareholders' equity, which is the number we use for calculating adjusted ROCE.Considering this equity level and our plans to simplify AIG's business and operational structure and to drive more predictable and sustainable profitability, we are confident that we will achieve our 10% plus adjusted ROCE goal. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.Peter Zaffino: Thanks, Sabra.

The metric excludes catastrophe losses and a ratio below 100 signifies the insurer earns more from premiums than it pays out in claims.Total consolidated net investment income for the insurer rose 33%, helped by higher income from fixed maturity securities and loan portfolios due to the higher reinvestment rates.Adjusted after-tax income attributable to common shareholders rose to $1.61 per share from 84 cents a year earlier.

Refer to page 18 for more detail.NEW YORK, November 01, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American International Group, Inc. (NYSE: AIG) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.AIG Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Peter Zaffino said: ""In the third quarter, AIG delivered exceptional results driven by continued improvement in underwriting profitability and an outstanding quarter in our Commercial Lines business with an 81.7% accident year combined ratio, as adjusted. This quarter’s adjusted after-tax income per diluted share of $1.61 increased 92% from the prior year quarter. Our relentless focus on our strategic priorities has enabled us to accelerate our execution and generate significant sustainable value for shareholders and other stakeholders.""On November 1, we announced the successful closing of the sale of Validus Re to RenaissanceRe for which we received total consideration of $3.3 billion in cash, including a pre-closing dividend, and approximately $275 million in RenaissanceRe stock. This sale significantly contributes to our efforts to streamline our business model, simplify our portfolio and further reduce volatility.""Our continued attention to underwriting excellence and portfolio optimization has manifested in outstanding results for General Insurance. The General Insurance combined ratio improved to 90.5%. The combined ratio included $462 million of total catastrophe-related charges, or 6.9 loss ratio points. Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, of 86.3% represents an improvement of 210 basis points from the prior year quarter. Additionally, the third quarter results reflect favorable prior year reserve development, net of reinsurance and prior year premiums, of $210 million, or a 2.7 loss ratio point benefit.""Our continued growth across the portfolio was impressive in the third quarter. General Insurance net premiums written increased 1% year-over-year, or 9% on a comparable basis†, driven by 16% growth in Personal Insurance and 6% growth in Commercial Lines. North America Commercial pricing, which includes rate and exposure, increased 9% excluding Workers’ Compensation, while International Commercial pricing increased 6% year-over-year. Global Commercial pricing increased 8% excluding Workers’ Compensation and remains above loss cost trend.""Life & Retirement also delivered solid third-quarter results, which were attributable to continued spread expansion and strong Fixed Index Annuities sales which exceeded $2 billion for the third consecutive quarter. Base net investment income continued to see benefits from the higher interest rate environment and Individual and Group Retirement produced a 41 basis point base spread expansion year-over-year.""Corebridge continues to make significant progress in simplifying its portfolio. In September, Corebridge announced the sale of AIG Life Limited to Aviva plc for a consideration of £460 million. On October 31, Corebridge closed the sale of Laya Healthcare to AXA for €650 million, the net proceeds from which will be distributed by a special dividend of approximately $730 million to Corebridge shareholders of record. These transactions will enable Corebridge to concentrate on U.S. Life & Retirement solutions where it has proven market strength and distribution capabilities.""† Net premiums written on a comparable basis reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis adjusted for the International lag elimination, the sale of CRS and the sale of Validus Re. Refer to page 18 for more detail.For the third quarter of 2023, net income attributable to AIG common shareholders was $2.0 billion, or $2.81 per diluted common share, compared to $2.7 billion, or $3.55 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter. The decline was primarily driven by a decrease in net realized gains, both including and excluding Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and embedded derivative, partially offset by higher General Insurance underwriting income and total net investment income. The decrease in net income was also attributable to lower ownership in Corebridge following the Corebridge secondary offering in June.AATI was $1.2 billion, or $1.61 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2023 compared to $0.6 billion, or $0.84 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter. The increase in AATI was due to higher underwriting income in General Insurance, higher net investment income and better results in Other Operations, partially offset by an increase in adjusted income tax expenses as well as an increase in non-controlling interest expense due to the Corebridge secondary offering. The third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 26.3% compared to 20.5% in the prior year quarter, driven by higher foreign income, which is taxed at rates higher than the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21%, and tax adjustments related to prior year tax returns.Total net investment income for the third quarter of 2023 was $3.6 billion, an increase of 33% from $2.7 billion in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher income from fixed maturity securities and loans due to higher reinvestment rates and improved alternative investment income compared to losses from both the hedge fund and private equity portfolios in the prior year quarter. Total net investment income on an APTI basis* was $3.3 billion, an increase of $747 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting the same trends.Book value per common share was $56.06 as of September 30, 2023, a decrease of 4% from June 30, 2023, driven by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) due to higher interest rates, and an increase of 2% from December 31, 2022, driven by the net impact of share repurchases. Adjusted book value per common share* was $78.17, an increase of approximately 3% compared to both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, primarily driven by share repurchases. Adjusted tangible book value per common share* was $72.62, an increase of 4% from June 30, 2023 and an increase of 5% from December 31, 2022, both primarily driven by the net impact of share repurchases.In the third quarter of 2023, AIG repurchased $785 million of common stock, or approximately 14 million shares, paid $261 million of common and preferred dividends and redeemed Validus debt for $289 million, inclusive of the loss on extinguishment of debt. AIG also received gross proceeds of $234 million from the sale of CRS. AIG parent liquidity was $3.6 billion as of September 30, 2023. Total debt and preferred stock to total capital ratio at September 30, 2023 was 33.7%, up from 32.3% at June 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in AOCL. Excluding AOCL adjusted for cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets, the total debt and preferred stock to total capital ratio* was 25.9% at September 30, 2023, relatively flat compared to June 30, 2023.On November 1, 2023, the AIG Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on AIG common stock of $0.36 per share. The dividend is payable on December 28, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 14, 2023.The AIG Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $365.625 per share on AIG Series A 5.85% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, which is represented by depositary shares (NYSE: AIG PRA), each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock. Holders of depositary shares will receive $0.365625 per depositary share. The dividend is payable on December 15, 2023 to holders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2023.FINANCIAL SUMMARYThree Months EndedSeptember 30,($ in millions, except per common share amounts)20222023Net income attributable to AIG common shareholders$2,741$2,020Net income per diluted share attributable to AIG common shareholders$3.55$2.81Adjusted pre-tax income (loss)$920$1,873General Insurance7501,367Life and Retirement784971Other Operations(614)(465)Net investment income$2,668$3,556Net investment income, APTI basis2,5353,282Adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders$644$1,158Adjusted after-tax income per diluted share attributable to AIG common shareholders$0.84$1.61Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted (in millions)771.1718.7Return on common equity25.9%19.8%Adjusted return on common equity4.6%8.5%Book value per common share$52.76$56.06Adjusted book value per common share$74.90$78.17Common shares outstanding (in millions)747.2704.6GENERAL INSURANCEThree Months Ended September 30,($ in millions)20222023ChangeGross premiums written$9,238$8,870(4)%Net premiums written$6,403$6,4621%North America3,1383,151—North America Commercial Lines2,7572,544(8)North America Personal Insurance38160759International3,2653,3111International Commercial Lines1,9922,0382International Personal Insurance1,2731,273—Underwriting income (loss)$168$611264%North America(439)235NMNorth America Commercial Lines(374)292NMNorth America Personal Insurance(65)(57)12International607376(38)International Commercial Lines469339(28)International Personal Insurance13837(73)Net investment income, APTI basis$582$75630%Adjusted pre-tax income$750$1,36782%Return on adjusted segment common equity6.7%12.4%5.7ptsUnderwriting ratios:North America Combined Ratio (CR)114.092.3(21.7)ptsNorth America Commercial Lines CR113.688.9(24.7)North America Personal Insurance CR116.4113.0(3.4)International CR81.488.77.3International Commercial Lines CR75.483.48.0International Personal Insurance CR89.897.27.4General Insurance (GI) CR97.390.5(6.8)GI Loss ratio67.559.6(7.9)ptsLess: impact on loss ratioCatastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums(9.8)(6.9)2.9Prior year development, net of reinsurance and prior year premiums0.92.71.8GI Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted58.655.4(3.2)GI Expense ratio29.830.91.1GI Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted88.486.3(2.1)Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted (AYCR):North America AYCR88.286.6(1.6)ptsNorth America Commercial Lines AYCR84.683.0(1.6)North America Personal Insurance AYCR112.8108.4(4.4)International AYCR88.686.0(2.6)International Commercial Lines AYCR80.479.7(0.7)International Personal Insurance AYCR99.995.9(4.0)General InsuranceOn July 3, 2023, AIG closed the sale of CRS for a pre-tax gain of $126 million.

North America Commercial Lines NPW declined 8% as reported, or grew 5% from the prior year quarter on a comparable basis†, attributable to positive rate changes, higher renewal retentions and strong new business production in Lexington and Retail Property, partially offset by lower Financial Lines premiums reflecting our continued underwriting discipline. International Commercial Lines delivered 2% NPW growth from the prior year quarter, or 7% on a comparable basis†, attributable to continued positive rate changes, strong retention, and robust new business production, partially offset by a decrease in Financial Lines. Global Personal Insurance NPW increased 14% from the prior year quarter, or 16% on a comparable basis†, primarily driven by Private Client Select resulting from changes in our reinsurance program, as well as growth in Travel and Personal Property.Third quarter 2023 underwriting income increased $443 million from the prior year quarter to $611 million, and included $462 million of total catastrophe-related charges, representing 6.9 loss ratio points, of which $367 million was in North America, mainly attributable to the Lahaina Wildfire and Hurricane Idalia, and $95 million in International. Third quarter 2023 catastrophe-related charges of $462 million were down 29% compared to third quarter 2022 catastrophe-related charges of $655 million, which included losses from Hurricane Ian. Third quarter 2023 also included favorable PYD of $139 million compared to favorable PYD of $72 million in the prior year quarter. The development in the third quarter 2023 was largely driven by favorable development on U.S. Workers’ Compensation business, partially offset by unfavorable development on UK/Europe Casualty and UK Financial Lines.The combined ratio improved 6.8 points from the prior year quarter to 90.5%, driven by a 7.9 point decrease in the loss ratio to 59.6%. The AYCR improved 2.1 points from the prior year quarter to 86.3%, driven by a 3.2 point decrease in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted* (AYLR) to 55.4%, reflecting continued earn-in of premium rate increases in excess of loss cost trends and continued benefit from the business mix shift, coupled with our execution on portfolio management strategies focusing on risk selection and improved terms and conditions. The expense ratio was 30.9%, a 1.1 point increase from the prior year quarter, largely from the business mix shift impact on the acquisition ratio.The North America Commercial Lines combined ratio improved 24.7 points from the prior year quarter to 88.9%, driven by favorable PYD compared to unfavorable PYD in the prior year quarter as well as lower catastrophe losses. The AYCR improved 1.6 points to 83.0%, driven by a 4.7 point improvement in the AYLR to 57.8%. International Commercial Lines combined ratio increased 8.0 points from the prior year quarter to 83.4%, driven by unfavorable PYD. The AYCR improved 0.7 point to 79.7% due to a decrease in the acquisition ratio, mainly attributable to changes in the business mix.The North America Personal Insurance combined ratio improved 3.4 points from the prior year quarter to 113.0% and the AYCR improved 4.4 points to 108.4%, primarily driven by the expense ratio improving 8.4 points to 46.0%. The International Personal Insurance combined ratio increased 7.4 points from the prior year quarter to 97.2%, driven by a decrease in favorable PYD. The AYCR improved 4.0 points to 95.9%, driven by a 5.6 point improvement in the AYLR to 54.5%, as the prior year quarter had elevated losses related to COVID-19 within Accident & Health.Annualized return on adjusted segment common equity* for the third quarter and year-to-date were 12.4% and 12.0%, respectively, compared to 6.7% and 10.3% in the prior year.† Net premiums written on a comparable basis reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis adjusted for the International lag elimination, the sale of CRS and the sale of Validus Re.

The increase was primarily due to higher base portfolio spread income as a result of improved base portfolio yields and higher alternative investment income. Combined base net investment spreads in Individual and Group Retirement continued to widen with a 41 basis point improvement year-over-year.Premiums declined 42% from the prior year quarter to $0.8 billion due to lower pension risk transfer volumes. Premiums and deposits* increased 4% to $9.2 billion. Fixed Index Annuities continued to be the top driver of strong sales and Institutional Markets also had strong sales, supported by $1.9 billion of new guaranteed investment contracts, partially offset by lower volume of Variable Annuities and pension risk transfer deals.Annualized return on adjusted segment common equity* for the third quarter and year-to-date were both 11.4% compared to 9.7% and 10.5%, respectively, in the prior year.During the third quarter, Corebridge returned $192 million to shareholders through approximately $146 million of common stock dividends and $46 million in share repurchases.OTHER OPERATIONSThree Months EndedSeptember 30,($ in millions)20222023ChangeCorporate and Other$(518)$(421)19%Asset Management Group51(47)NMAdjusted pre-tax loss before consolidation and eliminations(467)(468)—Consolidation and eliminations(147)3NMAdjusted pre-tax loss$(614)$(465)24%Other OperationsOther Operations adjusted pre-tax loss (APTL) of $465 million improved $149 million, or 24%, from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in addition to improved results in Corporate and Other.Corporate and Other APTL improved $97 million, or 19%, from the prior year quarter, largely due to lower general operating expenses, higher income from parent short-term investments, and the absence of mark-to-market losses on a legacy investment portfolio that was sold in the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement was partially offset by higher interest expenses related to Corebridge financial debt compared to the third quarter of 2022.The Asset Management Group (AMG), which includes the consolidated results of VIEs, recorded adjusted pre-tax loss of $47 million, reflecting a $98 million decrease from the prior year quarter, largely due to lower interest income and net losses associated with VIEs compared to net gains in the prior year quarter.Changes in consolidation and eliminations were attributable to elimination of intercompany net investment income of VIEs that are consolidated by AMG within Other Operations whereby the insurance subsidiaries report as net investment income for their investment in consolidated VIEs included in AMG. The third quarter of 2023 included the elimination of net losses compared to modest net gains in the prior year quarter.CONFERENCE CALLAIG will host a conference call tomorrow, Thursday, November 2, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. ET to review these results.

Some of the measurements AIG uses are ""Non-GAAP financial measures"" under SEC rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures AIG presents are listed below and may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Regulation G are included within the relevant tables attached to this news release or in the Third Quarter 2023 Financial Supplement available in the Investors section of AIG’s website, www.aig.com.Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context indicates otherwise, we use the terms ""AIG,"" ""we,"" ""us"" and ""our"" to refer to American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.AIG uses the following operating performance measures because AIG believes they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of AIG’s business segments. AIG believes they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG’s insurance competitors. When AIG uses these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided on a consolidated basis.Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and deferred tax assets (DTA) (Adjusted book value per common share) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-common share basis after eliminating items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value (1) of AIG’s available for sale securities portfolio, (2) of market risk benefits attributable to our own credit risk and (3) due to discount rates used to measure traditional and limited payment long-duration insurance contracts, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. This measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. In addition, we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets held by AIG in support of Fortitude Re’s reinsurance obligations to AIG post deconsolidation of Fortitude Re (Fortitude Re funds withheld assets) since these fair value movements are economically transferred to Fortitude Re. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in th...ese book value per common share metrics. Adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total AIG common shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets, and DTA (Adjusted common shareholders’ equity), by total common shares outstanding.Book Value per Common Share, Excluding Goodwill, Value of Business Acquired (VOBA), Value of Distribution Channel Acquired (VODA), Other Intangible Assets, AOCI adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets, and Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) (Adjusted Tangible Book Value per Common Share) is used to provide more accurate measure of the realizable value of shareholder on a per-common share basis. Adjusted Tangible Book Value per Common Share is derived by dividing Total AIG common shareholders’ equity, excluding intangible assets, AOCI adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets, and DTA (Adjusted Tangible Common Shareholders’ Equity), by total common shares outstanding.AIG Return on Common Equity (ROCE) – Adjusted After-tax Income Excluding AOCI adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and DTA (Adjusted return on common equity) is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders’ equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value (1) of AIG’s available for sale securities portfolio, (2) of market risk benefits attributable to our own credit risk and (3) due to discount rates used to measure traditional and limited payment long-duration insurance contracts, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. This measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. In addition, we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets since these fair value movements are economically transferred to Fortitude Re. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in Adjusted Return on Common Equity. Adjusted Return on Common Equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders by average Adjusted Common Shareholders’ Equity.General Insurance and Life and Retirement Adjusted Segment Common Equity is based on segment equity adjusted for the attribution of debt and preferred stock (Segment Common Equity) and is consistent with AIG’s Adjusted Common Shareholders’ Equity definition.General Insurance and Life and Retirement Return on Adjusted Segment Common Equity – Adjusted After-tax Income (Return on adjusted segment common equity) is used to show the rate of return on Adjusted Segment Common Equity. Return on Adjusted Segment Common Equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized Adjusted After-tax Income by Average Adjusted Segment Common Equity.Adjusted After-tax Income Attributable to General Insurance and Life and Retirement is derived by subtracting attributed interest expense, income tax expense and attributed dividends on preferred stock from APTI. Attributed debt and the related interest expense and dividends on preferred stock are calculated based on our internal allocation model. Tax expense or benefit is calculated based on an internal attribution methodology that considers among other things the taxing jurisdiction in which the segments conduct business, as well as the deductibility of expenses in those jurisdictions.Adjusted revenues exclude Net realized gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes), changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes) and income from elimination of the International reporting lag. Adjusted revenues is a GAAP measure for our segments.Adjusted Pre-tax Income (APTI) is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing operations before income tax. This definition is consistent across our segments. These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. APTI is a GAAP measure for our segments. Excluded items include the following:changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits;net change in market risk benefits (MRBs);changes in benefit reserves related to net realized gains and losses;changes in the fair value of equity securities;net investment income on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets;following deconsolidation of Fortitude Re, net realized gains and losses on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets;loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt;all net realized gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication. Earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized gains and losses to specific APTI line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances);income or loss from discontinued operations;net loss reserve discount benefit (charge);pension expense related to lump sum payments to former employees;net gain or loss on divestitures and other;non-operating litigation reserves and settlements;restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization;the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain;integration and transaction costs associated with acquiring or divesting businesses;losses from the impairment of goodwill;non-recurring costs associated with the implementation of non-ordinary course legal or regulatory changes or changes to accounting principles; andincome from elimination of the international reporting lag.Adjusted After-tax Income attributable to AIG common shareholders (AATI) is derived by excluding the tax effected APTI adjustments described above, dividends on preferred stock, noncontrolling interest on net realized gains (losses), other non-operating expenses and the following tax items from net income attributable to AIG:deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges;changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; andnet tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.See page 16 for the reconciliation of Net income attributable to AIG to Adjusted After-tax Income Attributable to AIG.Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.Accident year loss and Accident year combined ratios, as adjusted (Accident year loss ratio, ex-CAT and Accident year combined ratio, ex-CAT): both the accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses (CATs) and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events, in each case, having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million and man-made catastrophe losses, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. We believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management’s control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.Underwriting ratios are computed as follows:Loss ratio = Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred ÷ Net premiums earned (NPE)Acquisition ratio = Total acquisition expenses ÷ NPEGeneral operating expense ratio = General operating expenses ÷ NPEExpense ratio = Acquisition ratio + General operating expense ratioCombined ratio = Loss ratio + Expense ratioCATs and reinstatement premiums ratio = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred – (CATs)] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes] – Loss ratioAccident year loss ratio, as adjusted (AYLR ex-CAT) = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred – CATs – PYD] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes +/(-) Prior year premiums + Adjustment for ceded premium under reinsurance contracts related to prior accident years]Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted (AYCR ex-CAT) = AYLR ex-CAT + Expense ratioPrior year development net of reinsurance and prior year premiums ratio = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred – CATs – PYD] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes +/(-) Prior year premiums] – Loss ratio – CATs and reinstatement premiums ratio.Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life‑contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment‑type annuity contracts, Federal Home Loan Bank funding agreements and mutual funds. We believe the measure of premiums and deposits is useful in understanding customer demand for our products, evolving product trends and our sales performance period over period.Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.American International Group, Inc.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on APA Corp.\'s APA, American International Group Inc.\'s AIG and DoorDash Inc. DASH.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:The Gap, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), operates as an apparel retail company. GPS shares are widely outperforming the market over the past six months thanks to improved margins, resulting in a bevy of brokerage upgrades and price target hikes. The stock is hitting a series of higher highs and displaying relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this top-ranked stock.GPS stock is part of the Zacks Retail – Apparel and Shoes industry group, which ranks in the top 33% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock\'s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It\'s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.Company DescriptionWith more than 3,800 stores worldwide, The Gap is a premier international specialty retailer that offers a diverse range of clothing, accessories, and personal care products. The company tailors to both men and women with products under well-established brands such as Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta. Gap\'s main offerings include denim and khakis; eyewear, jewelry, shoes, handbags, and fragrances; and fitness and lifestyle products for use in yoga, training, sports, and travel.Story continuesThe Gap provides its products through company-operated stores, franchise stores, websites, and third-party arrangements. The company has franchise agreements to operate its portfolio of brands in stores and websites across Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.Earnings Trends and Future Estimates The apparel retailer has put together an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters. Back in August, the company reported second-quarter earnings of $0.34/share, a 277.8% surprise over the $0.09/share consensus estimate. The Gap has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 1,001.6%.GPS shares have received a boost on the back of lower airfreight and improved promotions, which aided margins during the second quarter. Management expects gross margins to expand in the current fiscal year. Lower advertising expenses and other cost-saving actions bode well for future quarters and are projected to generate $300 million in annualized savings.Analysts covering GPS are in agreement and have been increasing their full-year earnings estimates as of late. For the current fiscal year, analysts have increased earnings estimates by 2.9% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $0.71/share, reflecting a staggering potential growth rate of 277.5% relative to the prior year.Let\'s Get TechnicalGPS shares have advanced nearly 38% in the past 6 months. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping up. The stock has been making a series of higher highs and recently experienced a \'golden cross\', whereby the 50-day moving average crosses above the longer-term 200-day average. With both strong fundamentals and technicals, GPS is poised to continue its outperformance.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, The Gap has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and GPS continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run into the end of this year and beyond.Bottom LineBacked by a leading industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it\'s not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. Robust fundamentals combined with an appealing technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix.The Gap is ranked favorably by our Zacks Style Scores, with top marks in our Value, Growth, and Momentum categories. A resurgence in apparel stocks bodes well for GPS shares. The future looks bright for this highly-ranked, leading stock.Bear of the Day:Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile produces and distributes specialty plant nutrients and fertilizers, lithium derivatives, and industrial chemicals. The company provides potassium chloride and sulfate for crops such as corn, rice, wheat, and sugar. It also provides iodine for use in medical, industrial, and pharmaceutical applications.In addition, SQM offers lithium carbonates for various applications such as materials for batteries, air-conditioning chemicals, and heat-resistant glass. Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile was incorporated in 1968 and is headquartered in Santiago, Chile.The Zacks RundownSQM stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and is a component of the Zacks Fertilizers industry group, which ranks in the bottom 30% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has over the course of the year.Candidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poorly-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.Adding to the underperformance this year, stocks in this group are experiencing negative earnings growth.As a part of this group, SQM stock has experienced considerable volatility in 2023; shares recently touched a 52-week low.Recent Earnings Misses and Deteriorating Outlook SQM has fallen short of earnings estimates in each of the last two quarters. The company most recently reported second-quarter earnings back in August of $2.03/share, missing the $2.62/share consensus EPS estimate by 22.5%. Earnings plunged 32.6% from the same quarter in the prior year.The fertilizer company has missed earnings estimates by an average of 4.74% over the past four quarters. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and SQM is no exception.Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the third quarter, analysts have decreased estimates by 12.82% in the past 60 days. The Q3 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $2.38/share, translating to negative growth of -38.2% relative to last year.Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.Technical OutlookAs illustrated below, SQM stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how shares have plunged below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages signaled by the blue and red lines, respectively. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Also note how both moving averages have rolled over and are sloping down – another good sign for the bears.While not the most accurate indicator, SQM stock has also experienced what is known as a \'death cross\', wherein the stock\'s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. SQM would have to make a stern move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. Shares have fallen more than 45% in the past year alone.Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to hit new highs anytime soon. The fact that SQM is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock\'s downtrend.SQM shares continue to experience substantial volatility and have widely underperformed this year. With negative earnings estimate revisions continuing to pile up, this stock should be avoided as there are plenty of better alternatives in the current market environment.Additional content:3 Top Stocks Set to Beat Earnings Wednesday AfternoonWe are in the middle of the third-quarter 2023 earnings season.

The reported figure also plunged 40.9% from the prior-year quarter.Results reflect underperformance in the transaction-based businesses, specifically Investment Sales and Debt/Equity Advisory within Capital Markets and Leasing within Markets Advisory, owing to economic uncertainty, elevated interest rates and geopolitical instability in several regions. Nonetheless, the company benefited from the continued strength in its resilient lines of business.Revenues of $5.11 billion, although falling 1.3% from the year-ago quarter’s $5.18 billion, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.10 billion.The quarterly adjusted EBITDA margin dipped 200 basis points to 11.5% (USD) from the prior-year period. Lower transaction-based revenues and the change in equity earnings/losses, net of carried interest, led to this fall, which was partially offset by the benefit received from recent cost reduction actions.Per Christian Ulbrich, CEO of JLL, “JLL's third-quarter financial results reflected continued focus on diversifying our business. During the quarter, fee revenue expanded across our resilient business lines while the industry-wide slowdown in investment sales and leasing transactions continued. Our investments in technology and the improved efficiency of our operating model position us to expand margins even if a slower transaction environment persists.”Segment-Wise PerformanceDuring the third quarter, the Markets Advisory segment’s revenues and fee revenues came in at $992.4 million and $704.0 million, respectively, reflecting a fall of 10.7% and 17% (in USD) year over year. The decline was mainly due to the Leasing segment’s underperformance amid continued economic uncertainty, which has delayed commercial real estate decision-making, particularly for large-scale leasing actions. As a result, lower transaction volume and a decrease in average deal size across almost all asset types, specifically the office sector, hurt the segment’s performance.Revenues and fee revenues for the Capital Markets segment were $435.8 million and $431.4 million, respectively, decreasing 26.8% and 25.5% (in USD) year over year. The fall was mainly due to muted transaction volume compared with 2022 due to economic and interest rate uncertainty. This chiefly affected JLL’s Investment Sales and Debt/Equity Advisory businesses across almost all asset sectors and regions compared with the prior-year quarter.JLL’s Work Dynamics segment reported revenues and fee revenues of $3.51 billion and $497.7 million, respectively, up 6.8% and 9.9% (in USD) year over year. The uptick in revenues and fee growth was broad-based across service lines. Ongoing project execution, predominantly in the U.K., MENA, Italy and Southeast Asia, drove strong Project Management results while an increase in new, global client wins aided Workplace Management’s growth.JLL Technologies segment reported revenues and fee revenues of $58.9 million and $55.6 million, respectively, rising 4.2% and 5.5% (in USD) from the prior-year quarter levels. The growth in solutions and service offerings, largely from existing enterprise clients, supported the uptick.The revenues and fee revenues in the LaSalle segment fell 11.6% and 11.5% (in USD) year over year to $110.1 million and $102.7 million, respectively. The decline was mainly due to subdued transaction volumes, as evidenced by lower incentives and transaction fees. Although real estate valuation decreased over the trailing 12 months, adversely impacting assets under management (AUM), Advisory fee performance remained resilient.As of Sep 30, 2023, LaSalle had $77.7 billion of real estate AUM, down from $$78.2 billion as of Jun 30, 2023. This resulted from decreases in net valuation and foreign currency and dispositions and withdrawals, partially offset by the rise in acquisitions.Story continuesBalance SheetJLL exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $389.5 million, down from $402.5 million as of Jun 30, 2023.As of Sep 30, 2023, the net leverage ratio was 2.2, down from 2.3 as of Jun 30, 2023, but up from 1.1 as of Sep 30, 2022. The corporate liquidity was $2.1 billion as of the third quarter's end.The company repurchased 123,160 shares during the reported quarter for $20.1 million. As of Sep 30, 2023, $1,115.5 million remained authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program.JLL currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseJones Lang LaSalle Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated QuotePerformance of Other Broader Real Estate Market StocksCBRE Group Inc.’s CBRE third-quarter 2023 core EPS of 72 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents. The quarterly revenues of $7.87 billion also compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.63 billion. CBRE’s results reflected growth in its resilient lines of business, led by Global Workplace Solutions (“GWS”).However, on a year-over-year basis, the core EPS declined by 35.7%, while revenues increased 4.5%. Despite growth in GWS and other resilient businesses, commercial real estate capital markets were under significant pressure in the third quarter, leading to a continued slowdown in property sales and debt financing activity.Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. HST reported adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of 41 cents, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents. Moreover, the figure increased 7.9% from the prior-year quarter.Results reflected higher revenues driven by year-over-year occupancy growth and improvements in group business. HST also raised its 2023 outlook for AFFO per share.American Tower Corporation AMT reported AFFO per share, attributable to AMT common stockholders, of $2.58, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.35. The figure climbed 9.3% year over year.Results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues, aided by revenue growth across its Property segment. American Tower recorded healthy year-over-year organic tenant billings growth of 6.3% and total tenant billings growth of 7.3%.

P. Carey Inc. WPC is set to report third-quarter 2023 results on Nov 3, before the opening bell. While revenues are expected to reflect year-over-year growth, funds from operations (FFO) per share might exhibit a decline.In the last reported quarter, this New York-based net lease real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 2.26% in terms of adjusted FFO per share. \xa0Over the trailing four quarters, W. P. Carey’s adjusted FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions, met once and missed in the remaining one, with the average beat being 1.73%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:W.P. Carey Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseW.P. Carey Inc. price-eps-surprise | W.P. Carey Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteW. P. Carey owns a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality, operationally critical commercial real estate. It focuses on investing in high-quality single-tenant, industrial, warehouse and retail properties, mainly in the United States and Northern and Western Europe. The continued strength in demand in these asset categories during the quarter is expected to have led to healthy leasing activity and a gain in occupancy rates.The company leases its properties to tenants via long-term net leases with built-in rent escalators. This shifts most of the operating expenses, taxes and insurance costs to the tenant, paving the way for stable rental revenue generation and boosting top-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $459.5 million, indicating a 19.8% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Further, we expect WPC to have continued with its accretive investment opportunities backed by a robust balance sheet position.However, the choppiness in certain real estate categories, especially the office real estate market, is expected to have cast a pall on the company’s quarterly performance to some extent. Also, higher interest expenses are likely to have been a spoilsport.The company’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to secure analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly FFO per share has been revised 2.9% downward over the past month to $1.32. Moreover, the figure suggests a fall of 2.9% year over year.Story continuesQ3 DevelopmentsW. P. Carey’s board of directors has collectively approved a plan to exit the office assets within its portfolio. Given that the United States office real estate market environment has been choppy for quite some time now, the company’s decision seems prudent.This exit will be carried out by spinning off 59 office properties into a separate publicly-traded REIT — Net Lease Office Properties — and an asset sale program will be arranged for the remaining 87 office properties.The move is expected to benefit the company in terms of improving its overall portfolio quality and key portfolio metrics, including an increased weighting to warehouse and industrial assets. WPC anticipates achieving an improved cost of capital, enhancing its growth profile.Further, the spinoff and asset sale are likely to result in increased quality and stability of the company’s earnings and cash flows through better end-of-lease outcomes while maintaining a strong, scalable, investment-grade balance sheet.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for W.P. Carey this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — increases the odds of a beat. However, that is not the case here.Earnings ESP: WPC has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

The figure, however, declined 24.9% from the year-ago quarter.The results of this industrial REIT reflected healthy rent growth. However, lower occupancy and higher interest expenses were undermining factors. PLD also raised the midpoint of its 2023 core FFO per share guidance by a cent.American Tower Corporation AMT reported AFFO per share, attributable to AMT common stockholders, of $2.58, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.35 and climbed 9.3% year over year.Results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues, aided by revenue growth across its Property segment. American Tower recorded healthy year-over-year organic tenant billings growth of 6.3% and total tenant billings growth of 7.3%. It also raised its outlook for 2023.Equinix Inc.’s EQIX third-quarter 2023 AFFO per share of $8.19 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.79. The figure improved nearly 6% from the prior-year quarter.EQIX’s results reflected steady growth in colocation and inter-connection revenues as enterprises and service providers look to integrate artificial intelligence into their strategies and offerings. During the quarter, Equinix’s total interconnections reached 460,500, rising 1% sequentially and 4% year over year.

The quarterly results are likely to display year-over-year revenue growth and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 1.08% in terms of adjusted FFO (AFFO) per share. Its results reflected solid performance in the storage segment and the data center business.Over the trailing four quarters, Iron Mountain’s FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average beat being 2.93%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseIron Mountain Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Iron Mountain Incorporated QuoteFactors to NoteDuring the third quarter, Iron Mountain is expected to have benefited from its stable and resilient core storage and records management businesses. Storage rental revenue growth, which accounts for the lion’s share of IRM’s revenues, is likely to have been supported by healthy revenue management and volume trends.The company’s new and existing digital offerings, and healthy demand for traditional services, which comprise charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services, are likely to have aided service revenue growth.Moreover, robust demand for connectivity, interconnection and colocation space is likely to have driven healthy data center leasing activity in the quarter, boosting the company’s Global Data Center business quarterly performance.Further, Iron Mountain’s diversified tenant and revenue base across different industries is expected to have led to stable revenues during the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for storage rental revenues is pegged at $851.4 million, suggesting a 2.5% rise from the prior quarter’s $830.8 million and 12% from the year-ago period’s $760.0 million. Our estimate for quarterly storage rental revenues is pegged at $837.3 million, indicating an increase of 10.1% year over year.The consensus estimate for service revenues is pegged at $557.8 million, indicating a rise of 5.8% from the prior-year quarter’s $527.0 million. We estimate quarterly service revenues to be $569.5 million, implying growth of 8.2% year over year.In the second-quarter 2023 earnings presentation, management projected total revenues to be around $1.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA to approach $500 million, AFFO to be nearly $290 million and AFFO per share to be 99 cents for the third quarter.The consensus estimate for quarterly total revenues is pegged at $1.41 billion, suggesting an increase of 9.5% from the prior-quarter’s reported figure.Nonetheless, given that a major part of the company’s business lies outside the United States, adverse foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are anticipated to have impeded its quarterly performance to some extent.Also, higher interest expenses are likely to have been a spoilsport. We estimate third-quarter interest expenses to rise 23.6% on a year-over-year basis.The company’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been unchanged at $1.00 over the past month. However, the figure implies growth of 2.04% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an FFO beat for Iron Mountain this time.

The company’s quarterly results are expected to reflect year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.This Boca Raton, FL-based communications tower REIT delivered a surprise of 3.18% in terms of adjusted FFO (AFFO) per share in the last reported quarter. SBAC’s site-leasing revenues improved year over year on healthy leasing activity amid elevated tower space demand. Moreover, it has continued to benefit from the addition of sites to its portfolio.Over the preceding four quarters, SBAC’s AFFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed once, the average beat being 1.29%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:SBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseSBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseSBA Communications Corporation price-eps-surprise | SBA Communications Corporation QuoteFactors at PlaySBA Communications is likely to have benefited from the secular growth trends of the wireless industry in the third quarter. With the advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications, mobile data usage has increased significantly globally. Furthermore, the extensive use of network-intensive applications for activities like video conferencing and cloud services, coupled with the prevalence of hybrid work arrangements, has further contributed to this upward trend.Consequently, wireless carriers have increased their capital investments due to the growing demand resulting from global initiatives to roll out 4G and 5G networks, the expanding reach of wireless services and spectrum auctions. This heightened investment has supported the demand for SBA Communications' wireless communication infrastructure. This positive trend is likely to have stimulated robust tower leasing activities in the quarter, thereby enhancing the company's earnings for the period.Moreover, SBAC’s long-term (typically five to 10 years) tower leases with wireless service providers that have built-in rent escalators are likely to have supported stable site-leasing revenues for the company in the quarter, boosting its top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter site-leasing revenues, which account for the lion’s share of total revenues, is pegged at $628.54 million, indicating an increase of 7% from the year-ago quarter’s $587.30 million. Our estimate for quarterly site-leasing revenues is pegged at $624.6 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 6.3%.However, site-development revenues are expected to be on the lower side in the third quarter. The consensus mark stands at $50.10 million, implying a 43.3% decline from $88.3 million reported in the year-ago period. We expect this quarter’s site-development revenues to slide 42.4% year over year to $50.9 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total quarterly revenues is pegged at $678.01 million, implying year-over-year growth of 0.36%.SBAC’s solid balance sheet position is expected to have supported its investments in the existing 4G networks and efforts for 5G deployment. Also, asset-base expansion through acquisitions and development activities is likely to have given it an edge.The company’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were adequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly FFO per share has been revised marginally upward to $3.23 over the past two months. Moreover, the figure implies year-over-year growth of 4.19%.However, high interest expenses and elevated churn in certain markets where the company operates might have been a deterrent for SBAC’s quarterly performance to some extent. We estimate the company’s interest expense to have risen 12.2% year over year.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for SBA Communications this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.SBA Communications currently has a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.27%.

Results reflected lower-than-anticipated revenues. Higher interest expenses and lower contributions from adjusted EBITDA were undermining factors. While CCI maintained its outlook for 2023, it issued the 2024 AFFO per share guidance below the consensus mark.American Tower Corporation's AMT third-quarter 2023 AFFO per share, attributable to AMT common stockholders, of $2.58 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.35 and climbed 9.3% year over year.

If you\'d like to skip our detailed analysis of the real estate market, you can check out the 5 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.The housing market continues to struggle due to the combined pressures of increasing mortgage rates, soaring home prices, and limited housing inventory, creating a challenging situation for housing affordability. To exacerbate the situation, there is the possibility that the Federal Reserve will implement one more interest rate hike by the end of this year in an effort to further combat inflation. The federal funds rate serves as the key reference interest rate used by financial institutions for their short-term lending needs. In March 2022, this rate was nearly at 0%. Subsequently, the Fed initiated a series of rate increases to achieve its 2% inflation target. Following 11 successive interest rate hikes, the current rate range now stands at 5.25% to 5.5%, marking its highest level in 22 years.According to Federal Reserve forecasts, it is anticipated that the ultimate federal funds rate will climb to 5.6% by the conclusion of 2023. This implies the likelihood of at least one more 25-basis-point rate hike within the current year. Modifications to the federal funds rate can indirectly impact mortgage rates. However, experts in the housing market appear to be more focused on the Fed\'s longer-term rate plans in the years ahead rather than being overly concerned about a single additional interest rate increase in the current year. According to market experts, to achieve the most favorable scenario, a substantial increase in the available inventory of homes for sale is crucial. This additional inventory would alleviate the upward pressure on home prices, potentially stabilizing them or even leading to a slight decrease from their peak or near-peak levels. Furthermore, it\'s essential for interest rates to moderate, but caution against a rapidly cooling rate is also advised. Swiftly declining rates could trigger a surge in demand that might negate any gains in inventory, causing home prices to rebound.Story continuesOn the other hand, the real estate sector is presently undergoing a significant transformation, driven by technological advancements and increased access to capital. Those seeking to enter the real estate market should be prepared for the profound impact of online property listing platforms, smartphone applications, virtual reality, and blockchain technology on every facet of real estate transactions. According to a report, investors should expect heightened competition among property listing websites in the near term, all striving to offer seamless buying and selling experiences for prospective and current property owners. While market leaders like Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) have long maintained a dominant position, new platforms with similar offerings will continue to emerge, intensifying the competitive landscape. Technology is poised to play a pivotal role in the future of the real estate market, and established players must adeptly navigate this evolving landscape to avoid falling behind in a field brimming with competition.See also our list of the\xa010 Best Residential Real Estate Stocks To Buy.In their third-quarter earnings report, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) allocated $134 million for credit losses, mirroring the $161 million set aside in the second quarter. The bank attributed this provision to ""deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector."" Other banks\' recent earnings also revealed challenges related to their CRE holdings. For instance, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) disclosed on Tuesday that it had reduced its exposure to office-related CRE holdings by approximately 50% this year. Meanwhile, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reported an increase in non-performing loans, which are loans with at least 90 days of overdue payments, to nearly $5 billion in the third quarter, up from $4.27 billion in the second quarter, largely due to its CRE portfolio. Borrowers have faced difficulties refinancing their CRE loans as property values have declined and interest rates have risen. Notably, around $20 billion of office commercial mortgage-backed securities, which pool together individual loans, are set to mature in 2023.Conversely, the residential real estate (RRE) market appears to be showing more resilience. After experiencing a notable 10% drop in new home prices from their peak in February 2023, prices have shown an upward trajectory based on the latest data from April 2023. Additionally, the regional housing index published by the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo\xa0reinforces this positive trend.With these details in mind, let us now take a look at some of the best real estate and realty stocks to buy according to hedge funds, out of which the top ones include the likes of Equinix, Inc.

These companies represent the key life/health (L/H) insurance subsidiaries of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise) (headquartered in Minneapolis, MN) [NYSE: AMP] and are collectively known as Ameriprise Financial Group. Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR of ""a+"" (Excellent) of Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company (ACIC) (Burlington, VT), a property/casualty (P/C) subsidiary of Ameriprise. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. In addition, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of ""a-"" (Excellent) and the existing Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IRs) of Ameriprise. The outlook of these ratings is stable. Please see below for a detailed listing of the Long-Term IRs.The ratings of Ameriprise Financial Group reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).The balance sheet metrics for the RiverSource-grouped companies remain supportive of the very strong balance sheet strength assessment. On an enterprise level, the group has taken various steps to de-risk the balance sheet from interest rate volatility, and this has been accomplished primarily in the medium term through reinsurance. AM Best views the capabilities of Ameriprise’s mature risk management program supportive of this strategy. The group’s operating metrics include a return on equity well above industry averages at nearly 50% (excluding unlocking) and margins on a statutory reporting basis that reflect the strength of the group’s operating performance. Distribution capabilities are robust throughout the group’s adviser channel, leaning on an innovative delivery process and achieving operating efficiencies through its investments in technology. Ameriprise’s life and annuity business is complemented by the enterprise’s larger asset management businesses in the United States and internationally. As a group, the RiverSource companies not only are diversified geographically across the United States, but also offer investment services in addition to life and annuity products.Story continuesThe ratings of ACIC reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM). ACIC benefits from rating enhancement due to its strategic importance as a single-parent captive insurance provider.AM Best assesses ACIC’s business profile as limited due to its narrow market focus as a single-parent captive serving just one customer (its parent) for a limited amount of exposure. ACIC provides various coverages to its parent in the form of errors and omissions policies, a workers’ compensation deductible reimbursement policy, fidelity bonds and property terrorism (conventional and nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological). The captive has generated strong operating performance as demonstrated by its five-year average pre-tax return on revenue and equity ratios that compare favorably with the averages for AM Best’s commercial casualty composite. Additionally, ACIC benefits from a very low expense ratio.The following Long-Term IRs have been affirmed with stable outlooks:Ameriprise Financial, Inc. —-- ""a-"" (Excellent) on $550 million 3.70% senior unsecured notes, due 2024-- ""a-"" (Excellent) on $500 million 3.00% senior unsecured notes, due 2025-- ""a-"" (Excellent) on $500 million 2.875% senior unsecured notes, due 2026-- ""a-"" (Excellent) on $500 million 4.50% senior unsecured notes, due 2032-- ""a-"" (Excellent) on $750 million 5.15% senior unsecured notes, due 2033The following indicative Long-Term IRs have been affirmed with stable outlooks under the current shelf registration:Ameriprise Financial, Inc.—-- ""a-"" (Excellent) on senior unsecured debt-- ""bbb+"" (Good) on subordinated debt-- ""bbb"" (Good) on preferred stockAM Best remains the leading rating agency of alternative risk transfer entities, with more than 200 such vehicles rated in the United States and throughout the world.

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 155% in five years. Better yet, the share price has risen 4.8% in the last week. But this might be partly because the broader market had a good week last week, gaining 4.1%.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Ameriprise Financial managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 21% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Ameriprise Financial's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Ameriprise Financial's TSR for the last 5 years was 183%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAmeriprise Financial provided a TSR of 9.8% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 23% a year, over half a decade) look better. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Ameriprise Financial better, we need to consider many other factors.

(NYSE:AMP) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore, if you purchase Ameriprise Financial's shares on or after the 3rd of November, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 17th of November.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.35 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.40 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Ameriprise Financial has a trailing yield of 1.7% on the current share price of $310.56. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Ameriprise Financial has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 20% of its income after tax.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see Ameriprise Financial has grown its earnings rapidly, up 23% a year for the past five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Ameriprise Financial has increased its dividend at approximately 12% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.To Sum It UpIs Ameriprise Financial an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. Perhaps even more importantly - this can sometimes signal management is focused on the long term future of the business. In summary, Ameriprise Financial appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.In light of that, while Ameriprise Financial has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock.

A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our third quarter 2023 earnings release, our 2022 annual report to shareholders and our 2022 10-K. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. On Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the third quarter. Below that, you will see our adjusted operating results, followed by operating results excluding unlocking, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business, by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.Story continuesWe completed our annual unlocking in the third quarter. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results. And with that, I will turn it over to Jim.Jim Cracchiolo: Good morning and thanks for joining our call. Yesterday afternoon, Ameriprise reported strong third quarter earnings. The business continues to perform very well in a fluid and uncertain operating environment. Across the firm, we are helping clients navigate external pressures with our high-quality advice solutions and service. As you can see in our results, Ameriprise continues to benefit from the complementary strength and flexibility of our business and our talented team. Regarding the economic landscape, while inflation has come down a bit, it remains elevated, so it’s likely we will see higher interest rates for longer. Economic growth in the United States continues to hold up well even with increased rates.However, consumer sentiment in the United States is declining and we may see soft economic growth in the future. Additionally, the geopolitical climate is causing further volatility. Equity markets have been resilient and were up year-over-year but down slightly in the quarter. At the same time, many investors are holding greater levels of cash and feel comfortable earning competitive yields in cash products. Our assets under management and administration reached $1.2 trillion, up 12% and financials were also strong. We delivered record operating results in the quarter. Excluding unlocking and a regulatory accrual, total adjusted operating net revenue grew nicely, up 10% to $3.9 billion, and earnings were also quite strong, up 18% with EPS up considerably, an increase of 24%.Additionally, our return on equity was 49.9% compared to 48% a year ago. Very few firms in our industry achieved nearly a 50% ROE on an ongoing basis. Our complementary businesses consistently generate strong financial results. Let’s start with wealth management. Our advice value proposition is built for the current environment. Advisers are focused on ensuring clients are highly engaged and deepening relationships with them. Importantly, client satisfaction remains at an excellent 4.9 out of 5 stars. Total client assets increased 15% to $816 billion with good client net flows of $8.9 billion in market appreciation. We continue to attract more new clients and move up market as we grow our client base. And we know from industry research that more investors need guidance.In fact, among the fluent households, many investors in the marketplace still don’t have a formal plan to manage assets, income and expenses and retirement. As we highlighted previously, our advisers continue to hold a higher level of cash for their clients with the highest short-term yields they’re able to attain and the market uncertainty. Therefore, we continue to see a lower percentage of our assets moving into wrap with $5.4 billion in the quarter. As markets settle, we expect that money will ultimately be redeployed into wrap and other solutions. Our re-entry back into the banking business came at the right time and is very beneficial for the firm. Assets in the bank and certificate company continued to increase substantially up 37% to $35 billion.With interest rates at this level, we’re able to gain meaningful spread revenues that are sustainable when the Fed does start to cut rates. We will also be launching new products in the bank that will bring over additional client cash that they’re holding at other banking institutions. And overall, after a bit of a slowdown last year, we saw a nice increase in transactional activity up 11%. As you know, we continue to invest to put great capabilities in advisers’ hands to drive high satisfaction and growth and deliver an exceptional experience. We’re using advanced analytics to deliver an even better client and adviser experience. This includes a complete practice dashboard to enhance practice management, prepare for client meetings more efficiently, identify opportunities to grow their business and deepen their client relationships.In the quarter, we were back in the market with our successful Ameriprise brand advertising across TV, digital and social channels. We also redesigned our client website to even be more engaging, highlighting the unique benefits of working with an Ameriprise adviser. Adviser productivity increased another 10% to a new high of $901,000 per adviser in the quarter. Our adviser retention and growth are both consistently among the best in the industry. Regarding recruiting, we brought in another 64 experienced productive advisers. We had a bit of a seasonal slowdown of activity to begin the quarter but saw a nice pickup in September and we believe that we’ll return to more normal levels as we move through the rest of the year. Our reputation is an important differentiator.We recently learned that Ameriprise is being recognized for both a high level of customer trust and service. We received one of the highest customer trust index scores among financial services firms and foresters 2023 U.S. Customer Trust Index. And for the fifth consecutive year, J.D. Power has recognized Ameriprise for providing outstanding customer service experience for phone support for advisers. These awards build on the external recognition we have received over the years and are a testament to the dedication and expertise of our team. Finally, in terms of profitability, Wealth Management continues to generate strong pre-tax adjusted operating margin at more than 30% and earnings growth of 23%. Now let’s move to Retirement and Protection which is part of our wealth management solutions offering.We’re driving good sales in targeted focused areas that serve our clients’ comprehensive needs and generate good risk-adjusted returns. In our life business, we focused on variable universal life and disability products that are appropriate for this environment. Life and health sales were up nicely, increasing 22%, with the majority of sales in higher-margin accumulation VUL products. We’re also seeing positive initial results from our accelerated underwriting modeling, that’s highly automated and will drive further efficiencies as we roll it out more fully. In variable annuities, our structured product continues to attract good interest. Combined with our variable annuities without living benefits, sales were up 18% from a year ago.In the quarter, our RiverSource Retirement interactive tool which helps advisers create customized client presentations was recognized with several industry awards for innovation and ease of use. With the increase in rates, we’re able to garner improved yield in our high-quality investment portfolio. Excluding unlocking, pre-tax adjusted operating earnings were more than $200 million. Our RPS business has been highlighted as one of the most profitable in the industry. Let’s turn to Asset Management. As you saw in the quarter, assets under management were $587 billion, up 7%, it remains a challenging time, both in asset management and the active space in particular. Our flows were largely consistent with the industry. In retail, as we know, people are still hesitant to put money to work, so gross sales were a bit weaker.However, redemptions have improved and our overall flow rates in the U.S. are in line with active managers for the product disciplines we compete in. And in Europe, our flows have improved a bit from a year ago. Institutional mandates can be lumpy, but we were in net flows, excluding legacy insurance partners. We’re earning mandates in a number of areas, though LDI flows in total were down compared to a robust quarter a year ago. In regard to our investment performance, we have strong short- and long-term performance across equities, fixed income and asset allocation with a nice pickup in the short-term fixed income. And now about 70% of our asset-weighted funds were above the median for 3- and 5-year periods and more than 85% for the 10-year period.This is a positive and will help our ability to garner flows in the future. Also in the quarter, we completed one of the largest aspects of the EMEA integration, the transition to our global order management system. With that, we have now completed all of the large integration activities. We are now focused on adjusting our global operating model and expenses so we can continue to generate good margins in a tough climate. For Asset Management, adjusted operating margin was 36% and above our targeted range. G&A was down 3% adjusted for foreign exchange. We also have taken action to tightly manage expenses and we’re looking more fully across the business to continue to reduce expenses and leverage more operating efficiencies for the rest of this year and into 2024.I’d like to now come back to set the stage in the total firm. Our complementary businesses continue to give us the ability to deliver for our clients and generate very strong financial results over the years. Our capital strength and flexibility remain excellent. Our capital return to shareholders is among the highest in the industry and we have consistently generated strong financial returns over the years, including with our best-in-class ROE of approximately 50%. Ameriprise is situated very well, including with the complementary addition of the bank, which allows us to sustain the benefit from higher rates. We’re not standing still. We’re focused on areas of opportunity for growth and at the same time, we’re examining the entire expense base across the firm to further prepare, if the economic environment slows as we move into and through 2024.In closing, it’s the totality of our complementary business and the benefits that it provides back to our excellent team that enables us to consistently achieve this level of results. Now Walter will elaborate on our financials. Walter?Walter Berman: Thank you. As Jim said, strong results this quarter continue to demonstrate the leverage of our diversified business model, with adjusted EPS, excluding unlocking and regulatory accrual up 24% and to $7.87. Growth in fee-based and spread-based revenues, coupled with disciplined expense management drove excellent financial results which is a continuation of our strong and sustainable trend across this market cycle. Assets under management and administration ended the quarter at $1.2 trillion up 12%, AUMA benefit from strong client flows and market appreciation. Across the firm, we continue to manage expenses tightly relative to the revenue opportunity within each segment. While we continue to make investments in the bank and other growth initiatives, particularly in wealth management, we are taking a disciplined approach on discretionary expenses to manage margins across our businesses given the uncertainty in the macro environment.G&A expenses were well managed in the quarter, up 4%. Excluding the regulatory accrual General and Administrative expense grew 2% from higher business volumes and growth investments. Our G&A expenses remain on track with our expectations for the year. Our consolidated margin reached a record high of 27.5%, excluding unlocking and regulatory accruals. Balance sheet fundamentals remain strong. Our portfolio is well positioned, and we have strong capital and liquidity positions. This allowed us to return $663 million of capital to shareholders, a strong return of 81% of our operating earnings, excluding unlocking and a continuation of our differentiated track record. Turning to Slide 6. Revenue growth was strong at 10% from higher interest earnings and the cumulative benefit of client net inflows with average equity markets up 11%.Excluding unlocking and the regulatory accrual, pretax operating earnings increased 20% from last year, with meaningful benefits from strong client flows higher interest earnings and well-managed expenses. Let’s turn to individual segment performance, beginning with Wealth Management on Slide 7. Wealth Management client assets increased 15% to $816 billion driven by strong organic growth and client flows, along with higher equity markets. We’ve had $43 billion of net inflows over the past year, with $9 billion coming in this quarter from new clients joining the firm, the deepening of existing relationships and adding experienced advisers. Clients remain defensively positioned with a lower level of flows into wrap than we have seen historically.Our flexible model and broader offerings allow advisers and clients to pivot as markets and client preferences shift, while the money stays within the system. Revenue per adviser reached $901,000 in the quarter, up 10% from the prior year from a higher spread revenue, enhanced productivity and business growth. Turning to Slide 8. I’d like to provide an update on client cash levels. Our total cash balances reached a new high this quarter at $72.5 billion as we continue to see new money flowing into money market funds and brokered CDs as well as into certificates. This creates a significant redeployment opportunity as markets normalized for clients to put money back to work in wrap and over products on our platform. Cash sweep is launching working cash for our client accounts.While there is some seasonality with cash levels, cash remains an important component of the client’s asset allocation. Cash sweep and certificate balance ended the third quarter at $40.5 billion, down $5.8 billion from a year ago and down $1.5 billion sequentially. Since the end of August, cash levels have been essentially flat. Our sweep cash has an average size of $6,000 per account and 67% of the aggregate cash is now in accounts under $100,000, and we have seen very limited movement out of these accounts. The financial benefit from cash remains strong. This will be an important and sustainable source of earnings going forward. We continue to manage our investment portfolios prudently. Our bank portfolio is AAA rated with a 3.6-year duration.The overall yield on the investments in the portfolio is 4.7% and rising with the new money yield on investments in the second quarter of 6.5%. Our certificate portfolio is highly liquid of over half of the portfolio in cash, governments and agencies. It is AA rated on average with a 1-year duration. In total, specific company portfolio is now yielding 5.6%, with new purchases in the quarter at 6%. On Slide 9, we delivered extremely strong financial results and wealth management. Profitability, excluding the regulatory accrual increased 26% in the quarter with strong organic growth, the benefit of higher interest rates and continued client net inflows. The pretax operating margin was very strong at 31.1%, excluding the regulatory accrual. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% with distribution expenses up 9%, reflecting higher asset balances.Excluding the regulatory group, G&A grew only 2%, which was in-line with expectations, reflecting investments for growth and higher volume-related activity. We continue to expect AW1 full year 2023 G&A growth to be in the mid single-digit range. We remain on track to close the Comerica investment program partnership in November, which will bring approximately 100 advisers and $18 billion of client assets. Let’s turn to Asset Management on Slide 10. Financial results were very strong in the quarter, and we are managing the business well through a challenging environment that is impacting the industry. Total AUM increased 7% to $587 billion, primarily from higher equity markets and foreign exchange translation, partially offset by net outflows.Asset management, like other active managers, was in outflows in the quarter. Like others, we experienced pressure from global market volatility and a risk-off investor sentiment. Investment performance has been another critical area of focus, and we are seeing improvement, including in fixed income strategies. Overall, long-term performance remains very strong, and we had improvement in 1-year fixed income numbers. On Slide 11, in the quarter, asset management earnings increased to $199 million as a result of equity market appreciation, discipline and expense management, higher performance fees and $7 million of favorable timing-related items, which more than offset the cumulative impact of net outflows. The margin was 36% in the quarter. Importantly, we continue to manage the areas we can control.Expenses remain well managed, total expenses declined 1% with G&A decreasing $1 million. However, excluding the impact from foreign exchange translation, G&A was down 3%, reflecting early benefits from expense management initiatives. As Jim said, given the environment, we are taking a very focused look of course of business globally to further reduce expenses. Let’s turn to Slide 12. Retirement & Protection solutions continues to deliver good earnings and free cash flow generation. Reflecting the high quality of the business. In the quarter pretax adjusted operating earnings excluding unlocking, were $204 million, up 4% from the prior year, primarily as a result of the higher investment yields from the portfolio repositioning we executed last year.We continue to view normalized annual earnings of $800 million as a reasonable expectation for this business. We completed our annual actuarial assumption update in the quarter resulting in an unfavorable pretax impact of $104 million, primarily related to updates to persistency assumptions for variable annuities. Overall, Retirement & Protection Solutions improved in the quarter, with protection sales up 22% to $79 million, primarily in higher-margin UL products. Variable annuity sales grew 18% to $1.1 billion, with the majority of the sales in structured variable annuities. Our long-term care business continues to perform very well. The business is gradually running off as clients age. Our claims experience continues to perform very well and remain in-line with our expectations.Additionally, I’ll assess with both rate increases and benefit reduction strategies have exceeded our expectations. You can see additional detail of this block in the appendix of this presentation. Now let’s move to the balance sheet on Slide 13. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong, and our diversified high-quality investment portfolio remains well positioned. In total, the average credit rating of the portfolio is AA with less than 1% of the portfolio and below investment-grade securities. VA hedge effectiveness remained very strong at 94%. Our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable 90% free cash flow contributions across all business segments. This supports the consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders.During the quarter, we returned $663 million to shareholders and still ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of excess capital and $1.9 billion of holding company available liquidity. With that, we will take your questions.See also 20 Most Valuable Business Lessons to Make You More Successful and 10 Fastest Growing Regions in the World.To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.', 'Yahoo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill be right back...\nThank you for your patience.\nOur engineers are working quickly to resolve the issue.\n\n\n']"

AMGN,"['AMGNPR NewswireNovember 2, 2023 at 5:00 AM·13 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowAMGNWatchlistTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Nov. 2, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced new data for KRYSTEXXA® (pegloticase) showing a decrease in blood pressure during treatment of adults living with chronic gout refractory to oral urate-lowering treatment − uncontrolled gout − both with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD). The data will be presented at the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week, taking place Nov. 2-5, in Philadelphia.""As we seek to address the overall burden of uncontrolled gout, especially in those with coexisting chronic kidney disease, it is critical to further understand the benefits of treatment,"" said Brad Marder, M.D., medical director, nephrology at Amgen. ""Recognizing the high prevalence of hypertension among these patients, we\'re excited to present data that offers new insight into the potential role of urate reduction with KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate in regulating blood pressure.""In the MIRROR randomized controlled trial, 152 adults were randomized 2:1 to receive KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate (n=100) or KRYSTEXXA with placebo (n=52) for 52 weeks. Treatment groups had similar blood pressure prior to treatment. The decrease in systolic blood pressure during treatment was greater at Week 24 of treatment (-6±16 vs. -1±18 mmHg) and more sustained over the full 52-week treatment period in patients receiving KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate than in those receiving KRYSTEXXA with placebo. Compared to those with pre-treatment CKD (eGFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2), patients without pre-treatment CKD had a more pronounced decrease in blood pressure after Week 24 of treatment, with differences persisting through Week 52 of treatment.""Given the myriad of comorbidities uncontrolled gout patients live with, it is critical that clinicians understand the systemic connections and potential benefits of urate reduction,"" said Richard J. Johnson, M.D., professor, Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus. ""These new data add to prior studies and further support the potential role that both KRYSTEXXA urate-lowering and methotrexate administration played in the blood pressure changes observed.""Story continuesAdditional presentations include data from a validated microsimulation model used to project the potential health and economic benefits of effective serum urate reduction in those with both CKD and gout. In patients projected to have oral urate-lowering therapy inefficacy, treatment with KRYSTEXXA was projected to prevent 300,000 cases of uncontrolled gout by 2035 in this vulnerable CKD population.About KRYSTEXXA® (pegloticase)KRYSTEXXA® (pegloticase) is the first and only biologic approved by the FDA to treat adults living with uncontrolled gout, a painful and debilitating inflammatory condition with which people continue to have abnormally high levels of uric acid and symptoms despite the use of conventional therapies.In 2022, the FDA approved expanded labeling to include co-administration with the immunomodulator methotrexate, based on results from the MIRROR randomized controlled trial, which showed significant improvements in efficacy and safety, including a reduction in infusion reactions.About Uncontrolled GoutGout is a chronic, progressive inflammatory form of arthritis that is caused by high urate levels in the body. Tiny needle-like crystals can form and build up almost anywhere in the body. Patients with uncontrolled gout continue to have high levels of uric acid and ongoing symptoms of gout despite the use of oral urate-lowering therapies. Uncontrolled gout is a chronic, systemic disease, and if not addressed can have significant clinical consequences.INDICATIONKRYSTEXXA® (pegloticase) is indicated for the treatment of chronic gout in adult patients who have failed to normalize serum uric acid and whose signs and symptoms are inadequately controlled with xanthine oxidase inhibitors at the maximum medically appropriate dose or for whom these drugs are contraindicated.Limitations of Use: KRYSTEXXA is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNING: ANAPHYLAXIS AND INFUSION REACTIONS, G6PD DEFICIENCY ASSOCIATED HEMOLYSIS AND METHEMOGLOBINEMIAAnaphylaxis and infusion reactions have been reported to occur during and after administration of\xa0KRYSTEXXA.Anaphylaxis may occur with any infusion, including a first infusion and generally manifests within 2 hours of the infusion. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported.KRYSTEXXA should be administered in healthcare settings and by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis and infusion reactions.Patients should be\xa0premedicated with antihistamines and corticosteroids and closely monitored for anaphylaxis for an appropriate period after administration of KRYSTEXXA.Serum uric acid levels should be monitored prior to each infusion and treatment discontinued if levels increase to above 6 mg/dL, particularly when 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg/dL are observed.Patients at risk for glucose-6-phosphate\xa0dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency should be screened prior to starting KRYSTEXXA. Hemolysis and methemoglobinemia have been reported with KRYSTEXXA in patients with G6PD deficiency. KRYSTEXXA is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency.CONTRAINDICATIONS:In patients with G6PD deficiency.In patients with history of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to\xa0KRYSTEXXA or any of its components.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSGout Flares:\xa0An increase in gout flares is frequently observed upon initiation of anti-hyperuricemic therapy, including KRYSTEXXA. Gout flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended starting at least 1 week before initiation of KRYSTEXXA therapy and lasting at least 6 months, unless medically contraindicated or not tolerated.Congestive Heart Failure:\xa0KRYSTEXXA has not been formally studied in patients with congestive heart failure, but some patients in the pre-marketing placebo-controlled clinical trials experienced exacerbation. Caution should be exercised in patients who have congestive heart failure and patients should be closely monitored following infusion.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥5%) are:KRYSTEXXA co-administration with methotrexate trial: gout flares, arthralgia, COVID-19, nausea and fatigue; KRYSTEXXA alone: gout flares, arthralgia, COVID-19, nausea, fatigue, infusion reactions, pain in extremity, hypertension and vomiting.KRYSTEXXA pre-marketing placebo-controlled trials: gout flares, infusion reactions, nausea, contusion or ecchymosis, nasopharyngitis, constipation, chest pain, anaphylaxis and vomiting.Please see Full Prescribing Information,\xa0including Boxed Warning.About\xa0Amgen\xa0Amgen\xa0is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd.), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the Horizon Therapeutics plc acquisition (including the prospective performance and outlook of Horizon\'s business, performance and opportunities and any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected. We may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such acquisition or integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative.

Never miss another market-moving headline.Amazon started with Buy at HSBCHSBC initiated coverage on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a Buy rating and a price target of $160.00, as reported in real time on InvestingPro.The analysts wrote that despite Amazon’s underperformance compared to the S&P 500 for the last two years, the online retailer behemoth is expected to emerge from this phase as it capitalizes on previous investments and shifts its focus back to profitability. The analysts anticipate an improvement in e-commerce margins to levels seen in 2019, as well as strong growth in advertising, expected to rise by 24% to $46 billion in 2023.HSBC expects Amazon’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to grow at a 30% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2022 to 2025, supported by around 12% organic revenue growth and an annual margin increase of about 150 basis points.Shares were recently up 0.5% to $137.73.Roku raised to Hold following Q3 earningsPivotal Research upgraded Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) to Hold from Sell and raised its price target to $75.00 from $58.00 on Q3 earnings, which prompted shares to catapult some 30% in recent trading.The analysts noted that the results showed in-line net new active account growth as well as better-than-expected revenue, gross margin, and EBITDA.The analysts anticipate that Roku will likely exceed its typically conservative Q4 guidance and has a high chance of meeting its 2024 positive EBITDA targets, possibly even achieving positive free cash flow that year without compromising on product investment.Shares were recently changing hands at $77.41.Truist upgrades Amgen to BuyTruist upgraded Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $320.00 (from $260.00), citing the biotech\'s commercial execution and ""ability to grow mid-cycle assets"" to achieve record sales, ""despite underwhelming initial launches.""Story continuesTruist also wrote that Amgen\'s ""investment in derm and primary care sales force and DTC [direct to consumer] could continue to grow the topline,"" and noted further catalysts in GLP-1/obesity data.Shares were adding 2.2% to $266.68.Chevron upgraded to Outperform Bernstein upgraded Chevron (NYSE:CVX) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $182.00 (from $184.00) following the company’s announced Q3 results last week.The analysts highlighted several key factors for the upgrade, including a cleanup in the Permian Basin and an expected increase in volumes in Q4 despite previous issues. They also noted a cautious stance on capital expenditure for the mature Tengiz project in Kazakhstan, suggesting a conservative outlook.The analysts continued:""Refining reversals. Much of the miss was timing and in which quarter the value is accounted for is less critical for us. Joining the HES fan club. We\'re card carriers and as CVX communicates the value of HES growth to its value oriented shareholders, more will join. We expect geopolitical tensions wane and a return of CVX Israeli gas.""Earlier this week, Chevron was also upgraded by BofA Securities, which moved its rating from Neutral to Buy with a price target of $200.00 (from $190.00).Shares were up 1.8% to $146.54.Clorox upped to BuyCiti upgraded Clorox (NYSE:CLX) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $150.00 from $135.00 following the company’s surprise Q1 beat, with analysts saying they view the recent devastating cyberattack on the company as a ""one-time negative impact"" that it is already starting to ""wipe off.""The analysts specifically pointed out that Clorox posted Q1 results that surpassed the guidance set after the August attack. Despite a forecasted dip in fiscal 2024 guidance to account for the impact of that event, including a mid-high single-digit percentage decline in sales and EPS in the range of $4.30-$4.80, the analysts believe the revised guidance reflects a healthy dose of conservatism both on the top line and margin front.Clorox shares were lately up 7.8% to $124.32.TTM Tech raised to BuyTTM Technologies (NASDAQ:TTMI) shares rose nearly 2% pre-market today after Truist Securities upgraded the company to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to $16.50 from $16.00.This move follows the company\'s reported better-than-expected Q3 results, which led to more than a 12% jump in its stock price Wednesday.***In fast-moving markets, every second counts - and InvestingPro subscribers are always one step ahead with lightning-quick updates.Related ArticlesAmazon headed for rosy period, says HSBC; Roku flying: 6 big analyst picksElon Musk says Starlink has achieved breakeven cash flowHF Sinclair tops Q3 profit estimates on steady refined product demand', 'Yahoo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill be right back...\nThank you for your patience.\nOur engineers are working quickly to resolve the issue.\n\n\n', ""AMGNInsider Monkey TranscriptsNovember 1, 2023 at 7:31 AM·26 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowAMGNWatchlistAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript October 31, 2023Operator: My name is Julianne, and I'll be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin.Justin Claeys: Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Vikram Karnani, who joined Amgen from Horizon Therapeutics following the October 6, 2023 acquisition close, Dave Reese and Peter Griffith. Given the timing of these Horizon Therapeutics acquisition close, our third quarter results do not include any contribution from Horizon. Vikram will provide select information from Horizon's third quarter product sales for future context. You should have received a link to our slides that we have posted. Through the course of our discussion today, we will make some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance. And just a reminder that actual results can vary materially. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.A biotechnologist holding a test tube with a ground-breaking drug, showing off the company's pioneering developments.Robert Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Justin and thank all of you for joining our call. It's an exciting time here at Amgen. And we're continuing to execute well this year, serving many more patients around the world with medicines such as Repatha, EVENITY and Tezspire, advancing a number of promising first-in-class medicines rapidly through our pipeline and preparing for our next wave of biosimilar launches. However, as this is our first earnings call following the close of our acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, I thought we might turn our attention there first. The Horizon acquisition, coupled with our purchase of ChemoCentryx, which we acquired a little more than a year ago, gives Amgen a significant rare disease business that fits squarely within our overall strategy and will be additive to the growth we expect from our base business.Story continuesAt the heart of our strategy of course is innovation. First, our best-in-class medicines that make a big difference for patients suffering from serious diseases. The medicines in our rare disease portfolio like Tavneos, Tepezza, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA fit this description perfectly and they'll benefit from Amgen's decades of experience in inflammatory diseases. These medicines are also early enough in their lifecycles that we can positively impact their growth by leveraging Amgen's capabilities in process development, lifecycle management and manufacturing. Finally, we spent the past decade or so building out our international footprint with Amgen medicines now available in about 100 countries. And today our rare disease sales come almost exclusively from the U.S. So, we'll be able to leverage our global presence to quickly bring these medicines to patients around the world.You'll hear more in a minute from Vikram Karnani, who joined us through the Horizon acquisition and is leading a newly created rare disease business that is now the fourth leg of Amgen's commercial stool, alongside our inflammation, oncology and general medicine businesses. Turning to our financial performance in the quarter. Total revenues were up 4% and earnings per share were up 6% compared with a year ago. Volume increased 11% globally, which represents our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth. And we achieved good balance across all of our geographic regions and therapeutic areas. Seven of our medicines generated record sales in the quarter. And I'll highlight one of these, BLINCYTO, which delivered 55% sales growth in the third quarter.We see continued upside potential for BLINCYTO as it is increasingly used in earlier lines of therapy and as practice guidelines are updated to reflect the role this medicine can play in treating a broad range of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Turning to our pipeline. We had the opportunity to discuss six potential first-in-class oncology assets with you recently following ESMO. Three of these have earned Breakthrough Therapy designations from the FDA; tarlatamab, BLINCYTO and LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in colorectal cancer. We also continue to progress trials for bemarituzumab in gastric cancer, for Xaluritamig in prostate cancer and for AMG 193, our PRMT5 inhibitor, which has generated responses across six solid tumors.I'll just quickly note that AMG 193 was identified through our proprietary DNA encoded library technology which we added through the 2019 acquisition of Nuevolution, and it demonstrates our leadership in the emerging field of multi-specific drugs that can address pathways that have long been recognized but considered inaccessible to traditional drug discovery efforts. In other pipeline news, we've completed enrollment in our Phase 2 obesity study for maridebart cafraglutide, which was formerly known as AMG 133. And finally, the FDA has accepted our BLA for our biosimilar to EYLEA. Looking at our business, we feel we have good momentum across the board. We have everything we need with the portfolio, the pipeline and the people to deliver attractive sales and earnings growth through the end of the decade and beyond.As always, I want to thank Amgen employees around the world, including some 2,000 new colleagues focused on rare diseases for their commitment to strong execution on behalf of the patients we serve. With that, I'll now turn it over to Murdo Gordon. Murdo?Murdo Gordon: Thanks, Bob. I'm pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Execution is strong across the business with record quarterly sales for seven brands and robust volume growth across our general medicine, inflammation and hematology/oncology portfolios. Product sales increased 5% year-over-year. Volume growth was 11% with strength across our regions. U.S. volume growth was 11% and volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle-East and Canada region was 8%. Consistent with our international expansion strategy, Asia-Pacific continues to be our fastest growing region with 27% volume growth in the quarter. Starting with our general medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, Evenity and Aimovig. Overall revenue for these four products grew 21% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by 20% volume growth.Repatha sales increased 31% year-over-year in the third quarter, with volume growth of 44%, partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., volume growth of 45% was driven by a record number of new patients starting treatment, more than doubling year-over-year. We saw declining net selling prices in the US, primarily driven by new formulary coverage by CVS in July for commercial patients. Outside the U.S., we saw a 43% volume growth with strength across our regions. There are still many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha and we're rising to meet that challenge by investing and executing to drive awareness amongst physicians and patients. In the U.S., we have significantly expanded our primary care sales force and activated more than 15,000 new prescribers this year.We're also increasing promotion to patients through direct-to-consumer media efforts. Transitioning to bone health, Prolia sales grew 14% year-over-year in the third quarter, primarily driven by 7% volume growth and higher net selling price. We expect volumes for Prolia to grow supported by real-world evidence data presented earlier this year that demonstrate Prolia's superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with post-menopausal osteoporosis. EVENITY had record sales of $307 million for the quarter, driven by 48% volume growth. Osteoporosis disproportionately impacts postmenopausal women, and the diagnosis and treatment rates for these patients are low. In 2023, we expect approximately 3 million patients in the U.S. will be treated for post-menopausal osteoporosis, an estimated 40% of treated patients will be at very high risk of fracture.But only 6% of those high risk patients will be treated with a bone-building product. EVENITY plays an important role in the bone builder market with a 58% share in the U.S. and a 44% share in Japan. There's much more work to be done and we'll continue to invest to ensure EVENITY reaches the patients who need it. Otezla sales declined 10% year-over-year, driven by lower net selling price, unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, and lower inventory levels, partially offset by 1% volume growth in the U.S. Otezla net price declines were driven by higher rebates to support and expand access for commercial and Medicare Part-D patients. Our U.S. Otezla business has been impacted by free drug programs associated with new treatment options that have entered the psoriasis marketplace.We're beginning to see a reduced impact of these free drug programs as physicians and patients are experiencing barriers to access, given prior authorization requirements for these newer therapies. We have strong conviction in the growth potential of Otezla, with its unique indication for all severities of psoriasis, combined with an established clinical profile, broad payer coverage, a lack of testing required for initiation and convenient oral administration. To realize that potential, we have increased our investment to ensure physician and patients understand both the importance of treating psoriasis systemically and the safety and efficacy profile that Otezla offers. We are already seeing positive results from that increased investment, including significant growth in the number of patients requesting educational information and taking action on the Otezla website that generally indicate preparation for a discussion with the healthcare professional.And also recently increased our dermatology sales force by 20% to educate physicians about the benefits of Otezla for appropriate patients. With these increased investments, we expect to drive a return to growth for Otezla. Enbrel sales decreased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by an 8% decline from unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. Year-over-year volume increased 1% in the third quarter and the number of new patients in the U.S. starting treatment increased by 22% driven by improved payer coverage and Enbrel's 20-plus year track record of safety and efficacy. For the remainder of 2023, we expect our improved coverage will lead to continued growth in new patients and declining net selling price. Tezspire continues to show strong growth with $161 million in sales in the third quarter.Sales increased 21% sequentially, driven by 18% volume growth that benefited from the launch of our self-administered pre-filled single-use pen, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first quarter. We've now obtained coverage of the patent with the majority of pharmacy benefit managers, enabling easy access and convenient self-administration for patients in the U.S. with severe uncontrolled asthma. As we expected, Tezspire has both penetrated and helped grow the U.S. asthma biologics market. In 2023, the number of new patients on asthma biologics has increased by over 20% year-over-year and Tezspire's share of this expanded market is approximately 20%. Sales of Tavneos were $37 million in the quarter with 26% quarter-over-quarter volume growth.In the U.S., approximately 2,300 patients have now been treated with Tavneos by over 1,500 healthcare professionals. We continue to see an increase in awareness of Tavneos by rheumatologists and nephrologists. And exiting the quarter, we saw an increase in new patient start forms. Looking forward, we expect to bring Tavneos to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Amjevita sales increased 30% year-over-year for the third quarter, driven by 53% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. Ex-U.S. sales increased 10%, driven by 22% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. Moving to our hematology-oncology business, which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO . Strong commercial execution and compelling new clinical data drove 15% volume growth year-over-year for these six innovative products.BLINCYTO sales grew 55% year-over-year to a record $220 million for the third quarter. Volume growth of 56% was supported by broad prescribing to acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients following positive data from the registration-enabling E1910 study presented late 2022, and updated NCCN guidelines that were issued in May. Long-term, we see significant additional growth potential for BLINCYTO from earlier lines of therapy. LUMAKRAS reported $52 million in sales for the third quarter, a decline of 31% year-over-year. $22 million of this decline was driven by ongoing reimbursement negotiations in France. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS, driven by launches in new markets and our comprehensive global clinical development program.Vectibix sales increased 2% year-over-year for the third quarter to a record $252 million, driven by higher net selling price and 4% volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact. KYPROLIS grew 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by 8% volume growth. And Nplate sales increased 45% year-over-year for the third quarter, resulting from a $142 million order from the U.S. government. In the fourth quarter, we expect to fulfill an additional $62 million order for Nplate by the U.S. government. Given the strong performance of our hematology-oncology products and the exciting new positive data presented at ESMO on our oncology pipeline, we look forward to helping more patients with their cancer therapy. Overall, our execution is strong across the business, driving growth and demonstrating our dedication to serving patients.And with the expansion of our rare disease portfolio, we're excited to serve many more patients around the world who can benefit from our therapies. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram.Vikram Karnani: Thanks, Murdo. We're excited to bring together Horizon's medicines, pipeline and rare disease expertise with Amgen's history of leadership in inflammatory diseases, global infrastructure and world-class biologic capabilities. For those that are not as familiar with Horizon's portfolio, I will spend the next few minutes providing some background on our rare disease medicines. Horizon's business delivered $945 million of sales in the third quarter, representing 2% year-over-year sales growth with multiple positive leading indicators. Let me describe in more detail. Tepezza, the first and only medicine approved for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, regardless of disease activity or duration, generated $453 million of sales in the third quarter, representing 2% quarter-over-quarter growth.We are confident that now as we have officially joined forces and have on-boarded the full commercial team, we will make significant progress in advancing this important product over time to patients. We are driving several initiatives to continue to build the U.S. thyroid eye disease market. In the third quarter, we saw a greater than 50% year-over-year increase in the number of Tepezza prescribers, supported by the April 2023 FDA label update to treat patients with thyroid eye disease, regardless of disease activity or duration. We are pleased with this progress and are continuing to educate the physician community on new clinical data and updated indication across the full spectrum of TED patients. Second, large national and regional payers are continuing to make favorable policy changes to help eligible patients access Tepezza.To date, we have obtained favorable policy changes for greater than 30% of U.S.-covered lives, which are expected to take effect later this year and early next year. As a reminder, for Tepezza, there is a time lag between a patient being identified for Tepezza treatment and treatment being initiated. It can take up to 90 days for a patient enrollment form to move through the prior authorization process. Once that step is complete, then the patient's infusion needs to be scheduled at an appropriate site of care. This process takes time and we have taken several important steps to minimize the time between patient identification and treatment initiation. Finally, we continue to see approximately 100,000 patients with moderate-to-severe disease in the U.S. that are appropriate for Tepezza, with the majority of these patients in low Clinical Activity Score settings.Therefore, the patients -- the FDA's label update, combined with favorable medical policy changes by payers and supported by the expanding base of prescribing physicians, gives us a significant opportunity to reach more patients. These positive execution trends underpin our confidence in Tepezza's growth potential in the U.S. Moving on to markets outside the U.S. We continue to see international expansion as a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for Tepezza which received its first ex-U.S. approval in Brazil in the second quarter of this year. We are particularly excited about the opportunity to leverage Amgen's long-standing presence in multiple major ex-U.S. markets, including Europe and in Japan, where we have reported positive data from the Phase 3 OPTIC-J trial.We also continue to enroll a Tepezza Phase 3 trial in Japanese patients with chronic or low clinical activity thyroid eye disease. KRYSTEXXA, the first and only medicine approved for uncontrolled gout, delivered a record $253 million of sales in the third quarter, representing 32% year-over-year growth. Sales are now annualizing at a $1 billion run rate. Performance in the third quarter reflected continued strong uptake in both the rheumatology and nephrology segments. Strong results were driven by execution across all phases of the patient journey, demand-generation, stakeholder education and adherence to treatment. The FDA approved KRYSTEXXA's label change for combination with methotrexate in July 2022. We have seen a steady increase in uptake since then.Immunomodulation usage remained above 70% of new patient starts in the third quarter. We see an opportunity to redefine KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate as a standard of care and reach even more of the over 100,000 uncontrolled gout patients in the U.S. UPLIZNA sales increased 54% year-over-year in the third quarter to $67 million. International expansion is also underway with UPLIZNA now launched in multiple ex-U.S. markets, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Brazil. Additional indications in development also support UPLIZNA's long-term growth potential with Phase 3 trials underway in both IgG4-related disease, and myasthenia gravis. The rest of Horizon's portfolio generated $173 million of sales in the third quarter, primarily driven by our portfolio of ultra-rare medicines; RAVICTI, PROCYSBI and ACTIMMUNE.We see an opportunity for this basket of products to continue to generate robust sales. Before I turn it over to Dave Reese, I want to take the opportunity to thank all my colleagues in the rare disease business for maintaining their focus on patients throughout a period of distraction over the last several months. Looking ahead, we are excited to work together by leveraging Amgen and Horizon's combined capabilities to ensure our medicines reach more patients even faster who are suffering from serious and rare diseases globally. I'll now turn it over to Dave.David Reese: Thank you, Vikram. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by welcoming our new colleagues from Horizon. We are excited to be integrating Horizon's R&D capabilities with Amgen's to advance the promising Horizon pipeline. For R&D, the third quarter was one of high quality execution as we progressed our innovative pipeline with important oncology data readouts, the addition of two breakthrough therapy designations and completion of enrollment on key studies. We also advanced our innovative pipeline through rapid enrollment on multiple registration enabling studies. Starting with general medicine, we have completed enrollment in the Phase 2 study of maridebart cafraglutide in patients with obesity with or without diabetes.The goal of this study is to generate data that will provide optionality to design a broad Phase 3 program, leveraging the unique properties of maridebart cafraglutide that could potentially allow us to take a differentiated approach. We anticipate top-line data from this 52-week study towards the end of 2024. The Phase 3 outcomes study of Olpasiran are potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is enrolling very well. In inflammation, beyond severe asthma, we are investigating additional indications with Tezspire, including separate Phase 3 studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, which is fully enrolled and eosinophilic esophagitis. We also have a Phase 2 study in COPD that has been fully enrolled with top-line data anticipated in the first half of 2024.This study has recruited a broad population of COPD patients, including patients with both high and low eosinophil counts. Rocatinlimab, a first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, recruitment is off to a strong start on the ROCKET Phase 3 clinical development program. We have now randomized over 1,500 patients across the program. We are excited to present additional data from our expanded rheumatology portfolio following the acquisition of Horizon, including data from a Phase 2 study of dazodalibep in Sjogren's Syndrome, along with data from KRYSTEXXA, Tavneos, Otezla and other molecules from our broad portfolio at the American College of Rheumatology Convergence 2023 Meeting in November.I'll be brief with my remarks on our oncology portfolio, given the detailed oncology review last week. Based on the E1910 Phase 3 study, the FDA has granted BLINCYTO Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with CD19-positive Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the consolidation phase of multiphase therapy. We see future growth in BLINCYTO from advancements into earlier lines of therapy and subcutaneous administration. BLINCYTO also serves as a blueprint for how we plan to rapidly progress tarlatamab and Xaluritamig into earlier lines of therapy [indiscernible] setting a lower tumor burden. Along with experts in the field, we are very encouraged by tarlatamab, our BiTE molecule, targeting DLL3.At ESMO, we presented data from DeLLphi-301, a Phase 2 study in late-stage small-cell lung cancer, where we saw impressive response rates, durability of response, and overall survival in a setting where patients typically have limited options and a very poor prognosis. We are submitting these data to the FDA and are pleased that the FDA has granted tarlatamab Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Given our confidence in these data, we are rapidly advancing tarlatamab into earlier lines of treatment with multiple Phase 3 studies underway or planned. Based on emerging clinical data, we are discontinuing PSMA-targeting bispecific AMG 340, and we will focus our efforts on rapidly advancing Xaluritamig in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.We expect Xaluritamig dose expansion cohorts to be fully enrolled by the end of the year, and are planning to initiate additional studies in patients with earlier-stage prostate cancer. With AMG 193, a small molecule MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor, we are encouraged by the responses we've seen across six MTAP-null solid tumors, the manageable safety profile and preclinical evidence of CNS penetrants. We are now rapidly enrolling dose expansion cohorts. And with that, I'll turn things over to Peter for the financial update.Peter Griffith: Thank you, Dave. I'll review our third quarter results before discussing our updated 2023 guidance. Turning to our third quarter financial results, which are shown on Slide 44, total revenues of $6.9 billion grew 4% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.96 grew 6% year-over-year. The growth in revenues was due to product sales increasing 5% year-over-year, driven by a 11% volume growth. Third quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year. We advanced our pipeline and invested in growth opportunities in the quarter, while delivering a non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales of 52%. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 1.3 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 17.4%, primarily driven by higher profit shares and changes in product mix.Non-GAAP R&D expenses in the quarter decreased 2% year-over-year due to lower spend in research and early pipeline activities, partially offset by higher spend in later-stage clinical programs and marketed products. Year-to-date, non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 5% due to higher spend in later-stage clinical programs and marketed products, partially offset by lower spend in research and early pipeline. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the third quarter increased 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments, digitalization, driving productivity and accelerating use cases for artificial intelligence. Non-GAAP OI&E were a net $225 million expense in the third quarter. The year-over-year favorability was driven primarily by higher interest income and the change in Beijing accounting from equity method to a mark-to-market investments, with the impact included only in our GAAP results.Our third quarter non-GAAP tax rate increased 3.2 percentage points to 16.1%, primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change that replaced the excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue to prioritize investments in both internal and external innovation. In the third quarter, we increased investments in programs, including maridebart cafraglutide, I'll call it mari from now on, Rocatinlimab, Tavneos and ABP 206, our biosimilar to OPDIVO. Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth, including through simultaneous construction of our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. We're excited for the anticipated licensure of our Ohio facility in the first half of 2024.Additionally, we're making investments in all parts of our business to leverage the power of Generative AI opportunities. Third, we have a strong track record of returning capital to our shareholders and pay dividends of $2.13 per share in the third quarter, representing a 10% increase over the third quarter in 2022. The company generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2022. We will continue to generate strong cash flows. However, Q4 cash flow will be lower than historical patterns due to the timing of tax payments and Horizon transaction-related expenses. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2023 on Slide 46. We're pleased to have closed the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics.We're updating our full-year 2023 guidance to include Horizon financial results starting October 6, 2023. So our Q4 results will exclude approximately one week of Horizon's results. We are raising our 2023 revenue guidance to$28.0 billion to $28.4 billion versus previous guidance of $26.6 billion to $27.4 billion. For 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share, we are narrowing the range to $18.20 to $18.80 versus previous guidance of $17.80 to $18.80. We will add Horizon's business into Q4 without material non-GAAP EPS dilution. However, we do expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be lower than Q3 non-GAAP EPS because of planned investment increases in our business, including key assets in our innovative pipeline, beginning with mari, Olpasiran and AMG 193, and other strategic business investments, including Generative AI use cases in all parts of our business.This sequential pattern is consistent with historical trends. And in addition, Q4 non-GAAP EPS will begin to include the recognition of interest expense related to the Horizon financing as a non-GAAP expense, important additional points to consider as you model the remainder of 2023. We now expect other revenue for 2023 to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion versus our prior range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. With the Horizon acquisition, we now anticipate full year non-GAAP operating expense for 2023 to increase from our previous estimate of 3% (ph) to approximately 10% versus last year. Horizon represents approximately 5 percentage points of this 10% year-over-year increase. We continue to expect the full year 2023 operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%.We continue to expect non-GAAP cost of sales as a percentage of product sales to be between 16% and 17%. We now expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to increase from our prior guidance of 5% to about 10% year-over-year. Horizon represents approximately 3 percentage points of this 10% year-over-year increase. The additional 2 percentage points are driven by planned increase in our investments in our innovative pipeline, including mari, Olpasiran, and AMG 193. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A to be down year-over-year as a percentage of product sales slightly. We now expect non-GAAP OI&E expenses to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, up from our prior guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect Q4 OI&E to be about $700 million, reflecting interest expense related to the Horizon financing, which will be included in our non-GAAP results effective October 6.And as you begin to model 2024, note that we expect 2024 OI&E to be consistent with this Q4 run rate. This higher interest expense is driven by the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition at a weighted average interest rate of 5.6%. We expect to end 2023 with approximately $65 billion of long-term debt, including the current portion of it, and $11 billion of cash and cash equivalents. For the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% to 17%, down from prior guidance of 17.5% to 18.5%. We expect approximately 540 million shares to be outstanding in Q4. This increase from Q3 is driven by the conversion of unvested Horizon equity awards and the Amgen equity awards. Our 2023 capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately $950 million, up from our prior guidance of $925 million.The addition of Horizon's rare disease team further strengthens our confidence in delivering against our long-term growth objectives. We continue to allocate capital to advance innovation at speed and at scale. And I'm incredibly grateful to our now 26,000-plus colleagues for successfully executing our mission of serving patients. This concludes the financial update. And now, I will ask our operator, Julianne, please open the lines for Q&A and remind our participants of the procedure to ask their questions.

PSTAbout\xa0KRYSTEXXA® (pegloticase)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 KRYSTEXXA® (pegloticase) is the first and only biologic approved by the FDA to treat adults living with uncontrolled gout, a painful and debilitating inflammatory condition with which people continue to have abnormally high levels of uric acid and symptoms despite the use of conventional therapies.In 2022, the FDA approved expanding labeling to include co-administration with the immunomodulator methotrexate, based on results from the MIRROR randomized controlled trial, which showed significant improvements in efficacy and safety, including a reduction in infusion reactions.About Uncontrolled Gout  Gout is a chronic, progressive inflammatory form of arthritis that is caused by high urate levels in the body. Tiny needle-like crystals can form and build up almost anywhere in the body. Patients with uncontrolled gout continue to have high levels of uric acid and ongoing symptoms of gout despite the use of oral urate-lowering therapies. Uncontrolled gout is a chronic, systemic disease, and if not addressed can have significant clinical consequences.KRYSTEXXA INDICATION\xa0 \xa0\xa0 KRYSTEXXA (pegloticase) is indicated for the treatment of chronic gout in adult patients who have failed to normalize serum uric acid and whose signs and symptoms are inadequately controlled with xanthine oxidase inhibitors at the maximum medically appropriate dose or for whom these drugs are contraindicated.Limitations of Use: KRYSTEXXA is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING: ANAPHYLAXIS AND INFUSION REACTIONS, G6PD DEFICIENCY ASSOCIATED HEMOLYSIS AND METHEMOGLOBINEMIAAnaphylaxis and infusion reactions have been reported to occur during and after administration of KRYSTEXXA.Anaphylaxis may occur with any infusion, including a first infusion and generally manifests within 2 hours of the infusion. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported.KRYSTEXXA should be administered in healthcare settings and by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis and infusion reactions.Patients should be premedicated with antihistamines and corticosteroids and closely monitored for anaphylaxis for an appropriate period after administration of KRYSTEXXA.Serum uric acid levels should be monitored prior to each infusion and treatment discontinued if levels increase to above 6 mg/dL, particularly when 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg/dL are observed.Patients at risk for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency should be screened prior to starting KRYSTEXXA. Hemolysis and methemoglobinemia have been reported with KRYSTEXXA in patients with G6PD deficiency. KRYSTEXXA is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency.CONTRAINDICATIONSIn patients with G6PD deficiency.In patients with history of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to KRYSTEXXA or any of its components.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gout Flares:\xa0An increase in gout flares is frequently observed upon initiation of anti-hyperuricemic therapy, including KRYSTEXXA. Gout flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended starting at least 1 week before initiation of KRYSTEXXA therapy and lasting at least 6 months, unless medically contraindicated or not tolerated.Congestive Heart Failure:\xa0KRYSTEXXA has not been formally studied in patients with congestive heart failure, but some patients in the pre-marketing placebo-controlled clinical trials experienced exacerbation. Caution should be exercised in patients who have congestive heart failure and patients should be closely monitored following infusion.ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥5%) are:KRYSTEXXA co-administration with methotrexate trial:\xa0gout flares, arthralgia, COVID-19, nausea and fatigue; KRYSTEXXA alone: gout flares, arthralgia, COVID-19, nausea, fatigue, infusion reactions, pain in extremity, hypertension and vomiting.KRYSTEXXA pre-marketing placebo-controlled trials:\xa0gout flares, infusion reactions, nausea, contusion or ecchymosis, nasopharyngitis, constipation, chest pain, anaphylaxis and vomiting.Please see Full Prescribing Information,\xa0including Boxed Warning.About Otezla® (apremilast)Otezla®\xa0(apremilast) is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) specific for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels, which is thought to indirectly modulate the production of inflammatory mediators. The specific mechanism(s) by which Otezla exerts its therapeutic action in patients is not well defined.Since its initial FDA approval in 2014, Otezla has been prescribed to more than 840,000 patients worldwide.About Psoriatic Arthritis\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, inflammatory form of arthritis, which can cause swelling, stiffness and pain in and around the joints that worsens over time and can decrease physical function. It is estimated that nearly 38 million people worldwide have psoriatic arthritis. Around a third of people living with psoriasis may go on to develop psoriatic arthritis. If left untreated, psoriatic arthritis can cause disability.Otezla\xa0U.S.\xa0INDICATIONS\xa0Otezla\xa0(apremilast) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet\'s Disease.Otezla\xa0U.S.\xa0IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONContraindicationsOtezla\xa0is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to apremilast or to any of the excipients in the formulationWarnings and PrecautionsHypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have been reported during postmarketing surveillance. If signs or symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Otezla and institute appropriate therapyDiarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting: Cases of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were associated with the use of Otezla. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases, patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting; advise patients to contact their healthcare provider. Consider Otezla dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomitingDepression: Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with Otezla for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts/behavior, or in patients who develop such symptoms while on Otezla. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare provider if such changes occurWeight Decrease: Monitor body weight regularly; evaluate unexplained or clinically significant weight loss, and consider discontinuation of OtezlaDrug Interactions: Apremilast exposure was decreased when Otezla was co-administered with rifampin, a strong\xa0CYP450\xa0enzyme inducer; loss of Otezla efficacy may occur. Concomitant use of Otezla with\xa0CYP450\xa0enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is not recommendedAdverse ReactionsPlaque Psoriasis: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) are diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache, including tension headache. Overall, the safety profile of Otezla in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis was consistent with the safety profile previously established in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasisPsoriatic Arthritis: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) are diarrhea, nausea, and headacheBehçet\'s Disease: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) are diarrhea, nausea, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection.Use in Specific PopulationsOtezla has not been studied in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk of fetal loss.Please click\xa0here\xa0for Otezla®\xa0Full Prescribing Information.About\xa0TAVNEOS®\xa0(avacopan)TAVNEOS® (avacopan), approved by the FDA as an adjunctive treatment of severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis (GPA/MPA), is a first-in-class, orally administered small molecule that employs a novel, highly targeted mode of action. While the precise mechanism in ANCA-associated vasculitis (GPA/MPA) has not been definitively established, TAVNEOS, by blocking the complement 5a receptor (C5aR) for the pro-inflammatory complement system fragment known as C5a on destructive inflammatory cells such as blood neutrophils, is presumed to arrest the ability of those cells to do damage in response to C5a activation, which is known to be a driver of ANCA-associated vasculitis (GPA/MPA).About ANCA-Associated VasculitisANCA-associated vasculitis is an umbrella term for a group of multi-system autoimmune diseases with small vessel inflammation. Inflamed vessels may rupture or become occluded giving rise to a broad array of clinical symptoms and signs related to a systemic inflammatory response which may result in profound impairment in the kidneys, lungs and other organs. Prior to the approval of TAVNEOS in severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis, treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis was limited to courses of immuno-suppressants (cyclophosphamide or rituximab), combined with the administration of daily glucocorticoids (steroids) for prolonged periods of time, which can be associated with significant clinical consequences.TAVNEOS U.S.\xa0PRESCRIBING INFORMATIONTAVNEOS is indicated as an adjunctive treatment of adult patients with severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA] and microscopic polyangiitis [MPA]) in combination with standard therapy including glucocorticoids. TAVNEOS does not eliminate glucocorticoid use.TAVNEOS U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONContraindicationsSerious hypersensitivity to avacopan or to any of the excipients.Warning and PrecautionsHepatotoxicity: Serious cases of hepatic injury have been observed in patients taking TAVNEOS, including life-threatening events. Obtain liver test panel before initiating TAVNEOS, every 4 weeks after start of therapy for six months and as clinically indicated thereafter. Monitor patients closely for hepatic adverse reactions, and consider pausing or discontinuing treatment as clinically indicated (refer to section 5.1 of the Prescribing Information). TAVNEOS is not recommended for patients with active, untreated and/or uncontrolled chronic liver disease (e.g., chronic active hepatitis B, untreated hepatitis C, uncontrolled autoimmune hepatitis) and cirrhosis. Consider the risk and benefit before administering this drug to a patient with liver disease.Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions: Cases of angioedema occurred in a clinical trial, including one serious event requiring hospitalization. Discontinue immediately if angioedema occurs and manage accordingly. TAVNEOS must not be re-administered unless another cause has been established.Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation: Hepatitis B reactivation, including life threatening hepatitis B, was observed in the clinical program. Screen patients for HBV. For patients with evidence of prior infection, consult with physicians with expertise in HBV and monitor during TAVNEOS therapy and for six months following. If patients develop HBV reactivation, immediately discontinue TAVNEOS and concomitant therapies associated with HBV reactivation, and consult with experts before resuming.Serious Infections: Serious infections, including fatal infections, have been reported in patients receiving TAVNEOS. The most common serious infections reported in TAVNEOS group were pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Avoid use of TAVNEOS in patients with active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits before initiating TAVNEOS in patients with chronic infection, at increased risk of infection or who have been to places where certain infections are common.Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions (≥5% of patients and higher in the TAVNEOS group vs. prednisone group) were: nausea, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, fatigue, upper abdominal pain, dizziness, blood creatinine increased, and paresthesia.Drug InteractionsAvoid coadministration of TAVNEOS with strong and moderate CYP3A4 enzyme inducers. Reduce TAVNEOS dose when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors to 30 mg once daily.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd.), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the Horizon Therapeutics plc acquisition (including the prospective performance and outlook of Horizon\'s business, performance and opportunities and any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected.\xa0 We may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.

APH,"[""APHeditorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)November 3, 2023 at 5:02 AM·3 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowAPHWatchlistLet's talk about the popular Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$88.88 and falling to the lows of US$79.18. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Amphenol's current trading price of US$83.10 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Amphenol’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Amphenol Is Amphenol Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19.30% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Amphenol today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $69.66, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Amphenol’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Amphenol?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 14% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Amphenol. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in APH’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on APH, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Amphenol mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.1% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Amphenol Amphenol's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. Before making this announcement, Amphenol was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 13.2%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 27%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendAmphenol Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.105, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.88. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 24% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Amphenol has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 21% per annum. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.We Really Like Amphenol's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.

Reported EPS is $0.78, expectations were $0.74.Operator: Hello. And welcome to the third quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today’s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today’s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today’s conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.Craig Lampo: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol’s CFO, and I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2023 conference call. Our third quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter with sales of $3.199 billion in GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.83 and $0.78, respectively.A close-up of a circuit board with components depicting the intricate electronic componentry products the company produces.Third quarter sales were down 3% in U.S. dollars and low-income currencies and 5% organically compared to the third quarter of 2022. Sequentially sales were up 5% in U.S. dollars, local currencies, and organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $3.164 billion, which was flat compared to the third quarter of 2022, and up 4% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.99 to 1. GAAP operating income was $658 million in the third quarter of 2023, which included $9 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $667 million. GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 20.6% and 20.8% respectively in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin was down 10 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022 and increased by 30 basis points sequentially.Story continuesOn an adjusted basis, operating margin decreased by just 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022, but increased by 40 basis points sequentially. This modest year-over-year decreased and adjusted operating margin was primarily due to the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions, which are currently operating well below the corporate average. On an organic basis, we were very pleased with our operating margin performance, which represented a smaller than typical downside conversion on the lower organic sales levels. This strong organic performance reflected the agility of our team in adjusting costs, as well as the continued benefit of pricing actions taken in the prior year. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels.Our team continued to execute well on the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world. Breaking down third quarter results by segment relative to the third quarter of 2022, sales in the harsh environment solution segment were $887 million, an increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.9%. Sales in the Communication Solutions segment were $1.279 billion and declined by 16% in the U.S. dollars and organically. Segment operating margin was 22.1%. Sales in the interconnect and sensor system segment were $1.033 billion and increased by 5% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the Amphenol share price has climbed 79% in five years, easily topping the market return of 45% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 9.7% in the last year , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Amphenol To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Amphenol achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 21% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 12% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Amphenol the TSR over the last 5 years was 88%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Amphenol shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 9.7% over one year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 13% per year, is even more impressive. Is Amphenol cheap compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.But note: Amphenol may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Revenues are anticipated between $3.040 billion and $3.1 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.08 billion, indicating a decline of 6.53% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for earnings has remained at 74 cents per share over the past 30 days, suggesting a 7.5% decline from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.Amphenol’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.28%.Amphenol Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseAmphenol Corporation price-eps-surprise | Amphenol Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement:Factors to ConsiderAmphenol’s third-quarter top-line growth is expected to have suffered from reduced demand in the communications market. The top line is expected to reflect excess inventory pile-up in the IT datacom market, which has hurt demand. Moreover, cautious spending by service providers is likely to have hurt mobile networks’ market growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Communications Solutions accounted for 37.9% of Amphenol’s second-quarter 2023 revenues. Our model estimate for third-quarter Communications Solutions revenues is pegged at $986.7 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 35%.The company’s other two segments — Harsh Environment Solutions and Interconnect and Sensor Systems — contributed 27% and 33.4%, respectively, to second-quarter revenues.Harsh Environment Solutions revenues are estimated to decline 24.7% year over year to $597.3 million for the third quarter, per our model. Interconnect and Sensor Systems are estimated to increase 51.4% year over year.Amphenol’s diversified business model lowers the risks posed by the volatility of individual end markets and geographies.Contributions from the acquisitions of Control Measure Regulation Group, Integrated Cable Assembly Holdings, NPI Solutions, MTS Sensors, Halo, Positronic, El-Cab, Unlimited Services, Cablecon and Euromicron are expected to have aided its third-quarter results.Moreover, acquisitions have expanded its high technology and value-added interconnect product offerings in the diversified industrial market.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

These chips usually play a supporting role to the sexier “digital brain” that is the latest and greatest processor from Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Apple, or Qualcomm. While the digital brains get a lot more media attention, the supporting analog chips are as vital as those big expensive digital processors in driving value in electronic devices, which are becoming ubiquitous and intelligent throughout our lives.Anything with an on-off switch requires lots of these analog chips if it is going to relay input and output information with the physical world as well as manage the electrical power supply feeding the device. While these analog chips are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and distribute, it takes a long time to design and build a catalog of literally thousands of specific products to create the scale that makes them economically attractive businesses with a reputation of dependability and quality…” (Click here to read the full text)Story continuesA close-up of a technician's hands working on an advanced semiconductor substrate.Analog Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADI) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 89% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Losing money on investments is something no shareholder enjoys, least of all institutional investors who saw their holdings value drop by 3.6% last week. However, the 13% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Analog Devices. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Analog Devices?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Analog Devices does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Analog Devices' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Analog Devices. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 4.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 24 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Analog DevicesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Analog Devices, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$280m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 10% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Analog Devices. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices How Quickly Is Analog Devices Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Shareholders will be happy to know that Analog Devices' EPS has grown 36% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The music to the ears of Analog Devices shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 29% to 34% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.Story continuesOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Analog Devices.Are Analog Devices Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$83b company like Analog Devices. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$290m. We note that this amounts to 0.3% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Analog Devices but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Analog Devices To Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Analog Devices' strong EPS growth. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. Before you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for Analog Devices that we have uncovered.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

Let’s take a look at how the analog semiconductors stocks have fared in Q2, starting with Impinj (NASDAQ:PI).Demand for analog chips is generally linked to the overall level of economic growth, as analog chips serve as the building blocks of most electronic goods and equipment. Unlike digital chip designers, analog chip makers tend to produce the majority of their own chips, as analog chip production does not require expensive leading edge nodes. Less dependent on major secular growth drivers, analog product cycles are much longer, often 5-7 years.The 15 analog semiconductors stocks we track reported a slower Q2; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.9% while next quarter's revenue guidance was 5.17% below consensus. Technology stocks have been hit hard by fears of higher interest rates as investors search for near-term cash flows, and analog semiconductors stocks have not been spared, with share prices down 14% on average, since the previous earnings results.Impinj (NASDAQ:PI)Founded by Caltech professor Carver Mead and one of his students Chris Diorio, Impinj (NASDAQ:PI) is a maker of radio-frequency identification (RFID) hardware and software.Impinj reported revenues of $86 million, up 43.8% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 1.17%. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with a significant improvement in its operating margin but underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter.Impinj pulled off the fastest revenue growth of the whole group.

The firm says Friday\'s selloff looks like an overreaction to ""external sector dynamics,"" against a backdrop of Immunology momentum and commentary de-risking 2024 pricing.Wolfe Research upgraded Saia (SAIA) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $418 price target. While trimming the firm\'s ""high-end EPS estimates,"" the firm now sees a better entry point for ""arguably the best LTL growth story.""BofA upgraded Chevron (CVX) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $200, up from $190. The response to earnings that leaves Chevron shares 15% lower since the Hess (HES) merger was announced ""looks overdone,"" the firm tells investors.Raymond James upgraded L3Harris Technologies (LHX) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $210 price target. The firm says the business appears to be bottoming post the Q3 print.Oppenheimer upgraded Invitation Homes (INVH) to Outperform from Perform with a $35 price target.

If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.

Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2023 results, as well as having been posted on our website.It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon Plc.An HR specialist consulting with a business owner about employee benefits programs.Greg Case: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. As we begin the call today, we'd like to take a moment to reflect on the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza. We condemn violence anywhere that occurs in the world and remain highly concerned about all in harm's way. The safety and well-being of our colleagues and their families is always our top priority. And our team is in constant contact with our leaders in Israel to ensure our colleagues, their families, and our clients have our full support. As we reflect on the quarter, we want to start with a huge thank you to our Aon colleagues around the world for all they do every day to support each other and to support our clients.Story continuesTurning to financial performance. We delivered strong results in the quarter that contribute to year-to-date progress against our key financial metrics. Organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter was highlighted by double-digit growth in reinsurance solutions and health solutions. Year-to-date 7% organic revenue growth and ongoing operational improvement have contributed to 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth a strong performance. In our solution lines. Reinsurance solutions delivered another very strong quarter of 11% organic revenue growth with strong growth across Treaty Fac and our Strategy and Technology Group. In addition to delivering a strong quarter, our team is already helping clients prepare for the 2024 renewals.Health solutions also delivered another very strong quarter with 10% organic revenue growth as our team continued to drive strong new and renewal business. We see ongoing focus from clients to address underlying trends impacting their workforce and health care costs such as medical and wage inflation, population health, focus on well-being and overall talent engagement. Within wealth solutions, organic growth of 4% reflected strength in retirement as our teams continue to sell clients with pension risk transfer and regulatory change. Finally, commercial risk organic revenue growth of 4% reflected strong renewals and net new business with strength internationally in EMEA and the Pacific. However, overall organic revenue growth was negatively impacted by the external M&A and IPO markets as we communicated previously.Today we're also excited to announce actions to go further faster on Aon United and we will describe our plan and our restructuring program will accelerate key elements of our strategy. As always, our actions are driven by client need. For our clients the difficult reality of the current world is evident everywhere as they face increasing challenges, understanding, measuring and dealing with risk. Our forthcoming Global Risk Management survey details this trend with input from over 3,000 public and private clients of all sizes across geographies and industries. Trade, Technology, Weather and Workforce Stability are simple forces in today's risk landscape. While each of these forces are individually impacting risk exposures, the increase in connectivity is compounding complexity and presenting new challenges to business leaders.Responding to our clients' increasing and evolving demand, they'll protect and build their business we are advancing a series of actions to further accelerate our Aon United strategy. These actions taken over the next three years, will deliver outcomes that directly address client needs and demand. Specifically, we will improve the quality and availability and analytic tools available to clients, substantially improve their service experience and expand the quality and scope of solutions we bring to them. This work will put our clients in a much stronger position to make better decisions to support their companies. We will accomplish this by delivering on three commitments over the next three years. Internally, we call this 3x3 plan. The three commitments include: first, leveraging our risk capital and unit capital structuring capability to unlock new integrated solutions across our core business, but also address new requirements in client demand.Second, embedding the Aon client leadership model across our enterprise clients in large and middle market segments to further strengthen and expand our client relationships; and third, accelerating Aon business services plan to set a new standard for service delivery and next-generation analytic tools. The benefits of this plan accrue to our colleagues, our clients and our shareholders. Colleagues win with greater capability to serve clients. Today our team is exceptional in their client leadership focus and impact, and this work provides them with next-generation tools and capability to serve clients and to meet increasing client demand. Clients win with better solutions and better service. This work resets client service to a higher standard and provides analytic tools and solutions required to meet demand, and investors win through our greater client relevance continuing margin improvement and sustained double-digit free cash flow growth.And while we could have achieved these benefits over time, we have instead decided back now and accelerate a proven strategy. Let me describe where our team came to this conclusion. The last 10-plus years have demonstrated that a more connected firm is a more capable firm, and the connecting Aon is a done in concept that's accomplished through meaningful structural change, which must be embraced and led by colleagues. It is cultural and only viable as a defining part of our DNA. And even though we remain on a journey, with plenty of distance to travel and opportunity ahead to improve, we have made progress and the results have been meaningful for clients in terms of innovation and support, for colleagues in the form of excitement and engagement currently at an all-time high and for shareholders measured by sustainable value creation including, a 30.8% full year 2022 operating margin compound free cash flow growth of 13% a year from 2010 to 2022 and return on invested capital at year-end 2022 of 30.6%.However, two observations give us conviction that going further faster is a requirement. The first, is increasing client demand. And the second is, our execution confidence based on our proven track record the 3x3 action plan we have defined and the diligent work already underway. Accelerating our plan requires greater upfront investment. And as announced in our press release, we will execute this through a $900 million restructuring program, focused on two areas. First, is on accelerating our Aon Business Services plan by focusing on standardized operations integrating operating platforms and driving product innovation. And the second is, on workforce planning to align skills and capability required to deliver on the digital first opportunity embedded in AI business services as well as workforce changes to strengthen our client-serving capability and risk capital and human capital.This investment will also drive $350 million of cumulative annual run rate savings by year-end 2026, which Christa will describe in more detail. Overall, our team is very excited about the opportunity to accelerate our plans to strengthen client leadership and fortunate that we have the opportunity and options to take this step as a direct result of the work of our colleagues. We continue to expect to drive mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth over the course of 2023 and the long-term. We further expect these savings will contribute to ongoing annual margin expansion. And while the program will impact free cash flow in the near-term, over the long-term, we expect to continue to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth driven by operating income and working capital improvements.In summary, our strong year-to-date operational performance, including 7% organic revenue growth, 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and 10% adjusted operating income growth, demonstrates strong momentum against our Aon United strategy. It creates the opportunity for us to double down on our strategic commitments around risk capital, human capital, our client leadership model, and Aon Business Services. These steps will enable us to continue to address evolving client demand, improve colleague outcomes, and continue our track record of long-term shareholder value creation. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and long-term outlook. Christa?Christa Davies: Thanks so much Greg and good morning everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered strong operating results in the third quarter and year-to-date. Through the first nine months of the year, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 80 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth. These results position us very well to continue driving results in 2023 and over the long-term. We look forward to building on this momentum as we head into the last quarter of the year. As I reflect on our performance year-to-date, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 6% in Q3 and 7% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long-term.I would also note that reported revenue growth of 10% in Q3 includes a favorable impact from changes in FX of 2%, primarily driven by a weaker US dollar versus most currencies, compared to the prior year period. Reported revenue growth of 7% year-to-date includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX 1%, primarily driven by a stronger US dollar versus most currencies compared to the prior year period. I'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in organic revenue growth, with $80 million in Q3 and $196 million year-to-date or 3% of total revenue in Q3 and 2% of total revenue year-to-date. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement through the first nine months of the year with adjusted operating margins of 30.8% an increase of 80 basis points driven by revenue growth, efficiencies from Aon Business Services, overcoming expense growth, including investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth.We translated double-digit adjusted operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 15% in Q3 and 8% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings material, FX had an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.01 per share in Q3 and an unfavorable impact of $0.20 per share year-to-date. If currency remains stable at today's rates, we would expect a favorable impact of $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter, totaling an unfavorable impact of $0.17 per share for the full year 2023. I'd also note the change in other nonoperating expense had a $0.15 per share or 7% unfavorable impact in Q3 and a $0.59 per share or 6% unfavorable impact year-to-date. This reflects an unfavorable impact from an increase in non-cash net periodic pension expense, as well as balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period and a gain on sale of businesses in the prior year period.Turning to free cash flow. Cash flow from operations decreased $3 million year-over-year, reflecting double-digit operating income growth, offset in part by higher cash tax payments as we mentioned previously and the negative impact to working capital in the third quarter caused by temporary invoicing delays associated with the implementation of a new system. Free cash flow decreased 4% to approximately $2 billion, primarily driven by a $77 million increase in CapEx. CapEx was elevated in the first nine months of the year compared to the prior year period as we executed a number of technology projects to drive long-term growth. And net CapEx could be lumpy quarter-to-quarter and we expect CapEx to moderate in the fourth quarter to total CapEx investment of $220 million to $250 million in 2023.As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments on a disciplined ROIC basis and we expect it to grow the business going forward. Now let me share more details about our accelerating Aon United program. As Greg highlighted, we are doubling down on three strategic commitments, including accelerating Aon Business Services, which in turn enables us to unlock advancers in risk capital and human capital and our Aon Client Leadership strategy. Together, these commitments will drive more value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. The investment to accelerate our three-year Aon Business Services operating model focuses on the same three areas we've mentioned previously. We see proven benefit and will now accelerate. Number one standardized operating operations; number two integrating operating platforms; and number three increasing product innovation and development.We've already made considerable progress in standardizing our operations but we see significant opportunity both within and across our solution lines. The work we're doing to standardize operations will drive integrated service delivery platforms, which provide additional opportunities to standardize how we do business, and standard operations combined with integrated platforms enables more effective new product development and innovation at scale. By accelerating standardization across the portfolio and establishing fewer more integrated platforms, we'll be able to deliver more analytical tools to colleagues and clients across the entire portfolio. With this underlying infrastructure in place, we'll be able to leverage advances in AI and machine learning to further accelerate the product development cycle and unlock new efficiencies across the portfolio.Let me provide a bit more financial detail about the strategic investment. We expect total annual in-year savings of $350 million to be achieved in 2026, contributing to ongoing sustainable long-term margin expansion. I'd note we expect savings to ramp over time with annual Indian savings expected to be $100 million in 2024, $250 million in 2025 and $350 million in 2026. We do not expect material savings or impacts to cash flow in 2023. Cash restructuring charges of $900 million reflects the savings ratio of 2.6 times and a largely to technology costs and workforce optimization. I'd note you can think of the $900 million cash restructuring charge as less than 10% of underlying free cash flow over the next three years and the $350 million of savings as a 4% cost takeout relative to our cost base of approximately $9 billion.We also expect an additional $100 million of non-cash charges, largely related to asset and lease impairments. We do not expect significant incremental CapEx associated with the program and we expect CapEx will grow in line with the business in the future from our guidance of $220 million to $250 million in 2023. In the third quarter of 2023, we incurred $6 million of restructuring charges and we'll communicate charges and savings going forward each quarter. Contemplating the program, as we look forward we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long-term. We expect program savings will contribute to ongoing sustainable long-term margin expansion and expect to deliver margin expansion in 2023, 2024 and over the long-term.As we've noted previously, over the last 12 years we've delivered 1,120 basis points of margin expansion or about 90 basis points a year on average. Our outlook for free cash flow remains strong. We expect to deliver high single-digit free cash flow in 2023. I'd note this guidance contemplates the impact from restructuring on free cash flow in Q4 so we do not expect restructuring to have a material impact on cash flow this year. While free cash flow will be reduced in the near-term by restructuring we expect to return to our trajectory of double-digit free cash flow growth over the long-term driven by operating income growth and ongoing working capital improvements. As we've said previously, as we look at the opportunity in Aon Business Services and across our client-facing capability we know that delivering this strategy will result in long-term progress against our key financial metrics: organic revenue growth margin expansion and free cash flow growth.Now turning to capital allocation. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today highlighted by nearly $2 billion of share repurchase year-to-date. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities that we can scale to address unmet client needs. Our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our global priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to clients growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity.We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile and expect to add incremental debt as EBITDA grows over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade credit profile. In summary, our strong financial results in the quarter and year-to-date reflect strong operational performance driven by our Aon United strategy and our Aon Business Services platform. We see an opportunity to accelerate the next stage of our Aon United strategy and expect this investment will contribute to sustainable long-term top and bottom line growth and ongoing shareholder value creation. With that I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'd be delighted to take your questions.Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs.

If currency were to remain stable at today\'s rates, the Company would expect a favorable impact of $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2023, and an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.17 per share, or an approximately $51 million decrease in adjusted operating income for full year 2023.Effective tax rate was 16.6% in the third quarter compared to 18.0% in the prior year period. After adjusting to exclude the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, the adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was 17.2% compared to 19.1% in the prior year period. The primary drivers of the change in the adjusted effective tax rate were the geographical distribution of income and a net favorable impact from discrete items.Weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 204.6 million in the third quarter compared to 212.6 million in the prior year period. The Company repurchased 2.6 million class A ordinary shares for approximately $850 million in the third quarter. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately $4.1 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.YEAR TO DATE 2023 CASH FLOW SUMMARYCash flows provided by operations for the first nine months of 2023 decreased $3 million to $2,174 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher cash tax payments and a negative impact to working capital due to temporary invoicing delays associated with the implementation of a new system, partially offset by strong operating income growth.Free cash flow, defined as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures, decreased 4%, to $1,971 million for the first nine months of 2023 compared to the prior year period, reflecting a decrease in cash flows provided by operations and a $77 million increase in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were elevated compared to the prior year period as we executed a number of projects across technology to drive long-term growth.THIRD QUARTER 2023 REVENUE REVIEWThe third quarter revenue reviews provided below include supplemental information related to organic revenue growth, which is a non-GAAP measure that is described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue Growth and Free Cash Flow"" on page 9 of this press release.Three Months Ended September 30,(millions)20232022% ChangeLess: CurrencyImpactLess:FiduciaryInvestmentIncomeLess: Acquisitions, Divestitures\xa0& OtherOrganic Revenue GrowthRevenueCommercial Risk Solutions$\xa0\xa0\xa0 1,585$\xa0\xa0\xa0 1,4827\xa0%1\xa0%2\xa0%—\xa0%4\xa0%Reinsurance Solutions4653961715—11Health Solutions552494122——10Wealth Solutions35232683—14Eliminations(1)(2)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,953$\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,69610\xa0%2\xa0%2\xa0%—\xa0%6\xa0%\xa0Total revenue increased $257 million, or 10%, to $2,953 million, compared to the prior year period, with organic revenue growth of 6%, driven by ongoing strong retention, management of the renewal book, and net new business generation, a 2% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income and a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation.Commercial Risk Solutions organic revenue growth of 4% reflects solid growth across most major geographies driven by strong retention, management of the renewal book, and net new business generation. Growth in retail brokerage was highlighted by strong growth in EMEA and the Pacific, driven by continued strength in core P&C. The U.S. grew modestly driven by strength in the construction business and strong new business generation, partially offset by the impact of the external M&A and IPO markets. On average globally, exposures and pricing were positive, resulting in a modestly positive market impact.Reinsurance Solutions organic revenue growth of 11% reflects strong growth in treaty, driven by strong retention and continued net new business generation, as well as strong growth in facultative placements and double-digit growth in Strategy and Technology Group. Market impact was modestly positive on results in the quarter. The majority of revenue in our treaty portfolio is recurring in nature and is recorded in connection with the major renewal periods that take place throughout the first half of the year, while the second half of the year is typically driven by facultative placements, capital markets activity and advisory work that is more transactional in nature.Health Solutions organic revenue growth of 10% reflects strong growth globally in core health and benefits brokerage primarily from net new business generation and management of the renewal book. Strength in the core was highlighted by double-digit growth in almost all major geographies. Results also reflect double-digit growth in Consumer Benefit Solutions and strong growth in Talent, driven by data and advisory solutions.Wealth Solutions organic revenue growth of 4% reflects\xa0strong growth in Retirement, driven by advisory demand and project-related work related to pension de-risking and ongoing impact of regulatory changes. Investments was flat as strong advisory demand and project-related work was offset by declines in the real estate portion of our portfolio driven by real estate market movements.THIRD QUARTER 2023 EXPENSE REVIEWThree Months Ended\xa0September 30,(millions)20232022$ Change% ChangeExpensesCompensation and benefits$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 1,685$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 1,532$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 15310\xa0%Information technology13513322Premises747134Depreciation of fixed assets4237514Amortization and impairment of intangible assets2034(14)(41)Other general expense3002991—Accelerating Aon United Program expenses6—6100Total operating expenses$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,262$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,106$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 1567\xa0%\xa0Compensation and benefits expense increased $153 million, or 10%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth and a $37 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.Information technology expense increased $2 million, or 2%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to ongoing investments in technology platforms, particularly client facing technology.Premises expense increased $3 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year period.Depreciation of fixed assets increased $5 million, or 14%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to recent investments in ABS-enabled technology platforms to drive long-term growth.Amortization and impairment of intangible assets decreased $14 million, or 41%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a decrease associated with assets fully amortized in the prior year period and assets held for sale as part of ongoing portfolio management.Other general expense had a net increase of $1 million, or less than 1%, compared to the prior year period.Accelerating Aon United Program expenses were $6 million reflecting restructuring charges associated with the Program announced in the third quarter of 2023. The company expects to incur ~$900 million in total cash charges and ~$100 million of non-cash charges over a three-year period. The charges are expected to include technology-related costs for streamlining and simplifying operations, headcount reduction costs, and costs associated with asset impairments, including real estate consolidation costs.THIRD QUARTER 2023 INCOME SUMMARYCertain noteworthy items impacted adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin in the third quarters of 2023 and 2022, which are also described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income, Operating Margin and Diluted Earnings Per Share"" on page 10 of this press release.Three Months Ended September 30,(millions)20232022% ChangeRevenue$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,953$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,69610\xa0%Expenses2,2622,1067\xa0%Operating income$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 691$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 59017\xa0%Operating margin23.4\xa0%21.9\xa0%Operating income - as adjusted$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 717$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 62415\xa0%Operating margin - as adjusted24.3\xa0%23.1\xa0%\xa0Operating income increased $101 million, or 17%, and operating margin increased 150 basis points to 23.4%, each compared to the prior year period. Operating income, adjusted for certain items detailed on page 10 of this press release, increased $93 million, or 15%, and operating margin, adjusted for certain items, increased 120 basis points to 24.3%, each compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating income reflects organic revenue growth and increased fiduciary investment income, partially offset by increased expenses and investments in long-term growth.Interest income increased $2 million compared to the prior year period. Interest expense increased $16 million to $119 million compared to the prior year period, reflecting an overall increase in total debt and higher interest rates. Other income (expense) decreased $37 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and an increase in non-cash net periodic pension cost.Conference Call, Presentation Slides and Webcast DetailsThe Company will host a conference call on Friday, October\xa027, 2023 at 7:30 a.m., central time.

The factors identified above are not exhaustive. Aon and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. In addition, results for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any future period. Further information concerning Aon and its businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect Aon\'s financial results, is contained in Aon\'s filings with the SEC. See Aon\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to Aon and its businesses. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Aon is not under, and expressly disclaims, any obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Explanation of Non-GAAP MeasuresThis communication includes supplemental information not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""), including organic revenue growth, free cash flow, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted net income attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted diluted net income per share, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted other income (expense) – pensions, adjusted other income (expense), and adjusted income before income taxes that exclude the effects of intangible asset amortization and impairment, pension settlements, Accelerating Aon United Program expenses, capital expenditures, and certain other noteworthy items that affected results for the comparable periods. Organic revenue growth includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, fiduciary investment income, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. Currency impact represents the effect on prior year period results if they were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Reconciliations to the closest U.S. GAAP measure for each non-GAAP measure presented in this communication are provided in the attached appendices. Supplemental organic revenue growth information and additional measures that exclude the effects of certain items noted above do not affect net income or any other U.S. GAAP reported amounts. Free cash flow is cash flows from operating activity less capital expenditures. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the applicable tax impact associated with expenses for estimated intangible asset amortization and impairment, and certain other noteworthy items. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. Management also uses these measures to assess operating performance and performance for compensation. Non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, Aon\'s Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.Investor Contact:Media Contact:Leslie FollmerWill Dunn+1 312-381-3310+1 312-381-3024investor.relations@aon.com\xa0mediainquiries@aon.com\xa0\xa0Aon plcCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,(millions,\xa0except\xa0per share\xa0data)20232022% Change20232022%ChangeRevenueTotal revenue$\xa0\xa0 2,953$\xa0\xa0 2,69610\xa0%$ 10,001$\xa0\xa0 9,3497\xa0%ExpensesCompensation and benefits1,6851,53210\xa0%5,2314,9386\xa0%Information technology1351332\xa0%4033719\xa0%Premises74714\xa0%217216—\xa0%Depreciation of fixed assets423714\xa0%1191153\xa0%Amortization and impairment of intangible assets2034(41)\xa0%7087(20)\xa0%Other general expense300299—\xa0%949965(2)\xa0%Accelerating Aon United Program expenses6—100\xa0%6—100\xa0%Total operating expenses2,2622,1067\xa0%6,9956,6925\xa0%Operating income69159017\xa0%3,0062,65713\xa0%Interest income9729\xa0%191527\xa0%Interest expense(119)(103)16\xa0%(360)(296)22\xa0%Other income (expense)(21)16(231)\xa0%(105)71(248)\xa0%Income before income taxes56051010\xa0%2,5602,4475\xa0%Income tax expense (1)93921\xa0%439467(6)\xa0%Net income46741812\xa0%2,1211,9807\xa0%Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests111010\xa0%554815\xa0%Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 456$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 40812\xa0%$\xa0\xa0 2,066$\xa0\xa0 1,9327\xa0%Basic net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 2.25$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 1.9317\xa0%$\xa0\xa0 10.10$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 9.0611\xa0%Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 2.23$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 1.9216\xa0%$\xa0\xa0 10.03$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 9.0011\xa0%Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding - basic202.9210.9(4)\xa0%204.6213.2(4)\xa0%Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding - diluted204.6212.6(4)\xa0%206.0214.6(4)\xa0%(1)The effective tax rate was 16.6% and 18.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 17.1% and 19.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\xa0Aon plcReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue Growth and Free Cash Flow (Unaudited)Organic Revenue Growth (Unaudited)Three Months EndedSeptember 30,(millions)20232022% ChangeLess: CurrencyImpact\xa0(1)Less:Fiduciary InvestmentIncome (2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures\xa0& OtherOrganicRevenue Growth\xa0(3)RevenueCommercial Risk Solutions$\xa0\xa0\xa0 1,585$\xa0\xa0\xa0 1,4827\xa0%1\xa0%2\xa0%—\xa0%4\xa0%Reinsurance Solutions4653961715—11Health Solutions552494122——10Wealth Solutions35232683—14Elimination(1)(2)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,953$\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,69610\xa0%2\xa0%2\xa0%—\xa0%6\xa0%Nine Months Ended September 30,(millions)20232022% ChangeLess: CurrencyImpact\xa0(1)Less: FiduciaryInvestmentIncome (2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures\xa0& OtherOrganic RevenueGrowth\xa0(3)RevenueCommercial Risk Solutions$\xa0\xa0\xa0 5,137$\xa0\xa0\xa0 4,8935\xa0%(1)\xa0%2\xa0%(1)\xa0%5\xa0%Reinsurance Solutions2,1491,90913(1)329Health Solutions1,6701,5468(1)——9Wealth Solutions1,0541,0144———4Elimination(9)(13)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$\xa0 10,001$\xa0\xa0\xa0 9,3497\xa0%(1)\xa0%2\xa0%(1)\xa0%7\xa0%(1)Currency impact represents the effect on prior year period results if they were translated at current period foreign exchange rates.(2)Fiduciary investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $80 million and $26 million, respectively.

A strong Commercial Risk Solutions performance is expected in the quarter under review, along with increasing costs.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share of $2.23 suggests a 10.4% increase from the prior-year figure of $2.02. The consensus mark remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for third-quarter revenues of $2.9 billion indicates a 6.7% increase from the year-ago reported figure.AON beat the consensus estimate for earnings in two of the trailing four quarters and missed on the other two occasions, with the average surprise being 0.5%. This is depicted in the graph below:Aon plc Price and EPS SurpriseAon plc price-eps-surprise | Aon plc QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AON’s previous-quarter performance first.Q2 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, the leading global risk management services provider’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.76 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1%, primarily due to increased operating expenses. However, the negatives were partially offset by strong P&C business retention, business generation and solid performance in Commercial Risk Solutions’ Asia and Pacific region operations.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up before the third-quarter earnings announcement.Q3 Factors to NoteCommercial Risk Solutions’ performance in the third quarter is likely to have gained from new business generation, robust retention and skillful management of the renewal book portfolio. Strong performances in various geographical regions, including Asia and the Pacific, are expected to have had a positive impact on their performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Commercial Risk Solutions line’s revenues indicates 5.8% growth from $1,482 million a year ago, whereas our model predicts a 5.1% increase. We expect the unit to witness 5% organic revenue growth in the quarter under discussion, along with a 2% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income.Story continuesThe consensus mark for the Health Solutions line’s third-quarter revenues suggests more than 7% growth from the year-ago level, while our projection anticipates a 6% increase. The segment's growth is likely to have been supported by an increase in core health and benefits brokerage. Additionally, the growth in the Talent business, driven by data and advisory solutions, is expected to positively impact the unit's results for the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Reinsurance Solutions' revenues indicates growth of over 10% compared to the $396 million from a year ago, while our model forecasts approximately a 9% increase. It is expected to have witnessed growth in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of sustained new business generation, strong retention and investment banking growth. Additionally, improvements in the Strategy and Technology Group are likely to have had a positive impact on the unit's performance in the third quarter.The consensus estimate for third-quarter revenues in the Wealth Solutions segment suggests a 3.9% increase from the previous year, whereas our model foresees a 3% rise. The unit is likely to have been supported by heightened demand for advisory services, project-related activities and retirement growth during the quarter under review.All the factors stated above are likely to have positioned the company for overall year-over-year growth. However, escalating expenses due to substantial investments in the priority areas for long-term growth and an increase in certain discretionary and other expenses are likely to have partially offset the upside, making an earnings beat uncertain.Our model suggests the total operating costs in the third quarter to have increased more than 4%, primarily attributed to increased expenses related to information technology, as well as higher compensation and benefits. Specifically, the estimate for information technology expenses is set at approximately $138 million, while compensation and benefits cost is pegged at more than $1.6 billion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AON this time around. The combination of a positive\xa0Earnings ESP\xa0and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -0.18%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.23 per share.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our\xa0Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AON currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for AON, here are some companies from the broader Finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Welltower Inc. WELL has an Earnings ESP of +0.45% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player. You can see\xa0the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Welltower’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 89 cents per share, indicating 6% year-over-year growth. It has remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for WELL’s revenues is pegged at $1.6 billion, suggesting a 10.8% increase from a year ago.Cboe Global Markets, Inc. CBOE has an Earnings ESP of +0.71% and a Zacks Rank of 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cboe Global’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.84 per share, indicating 5.8% growth from a year ago.

Year-to-date economic losses totalled $295 billion, compared to a 21st century annual average of $310 billion.The aggregated death toll from 2023 natural catastrophe events had breached 75,000 during the same period, making 2023 the deadliest year since 2010.In Q3 alone, there were at least four individual billion-dollar insured loss events for SCS in the U.S., which will likely increase to seven events due to continued loss development. For the first time, insured losses from SCS in the U.S. surpassed $50 billion and accounted for 60% of global insured losses. The peril also resonated in Europe, which endured two individual billion-dollar SCS events, including Italy recording its first billion-dollar SCS insurance loss.Other notable natural hazard events that took place during Q3 2023 included:Widespread flooding in Beijing and several Chinese provinces in early August resulted in the costliest global economic loss event of Q3.On September 8, a magnitude-6.8 earthquake occurred in the Moroccan High Atlas Mountain range, claiming nearly 3,000 lives, injuring more than 5,600 people, and causing significant material damage across the affected area.The destructive flash flooding in northeastern Libya in early September damaged thousands of buildings in Derna city and ranked as the second deadliest event of the year, with more than 4,300 fatalities.Hurricane losses in the U.S. were lower than average in Q3, which is considered the peak of the Pacific and Atlantic hurricane seasons. Two notable tropical systems, Hilary and Idalia, still caused significant losses that, collectively, reached into billions of USD.Story continuesMichal Lorinc, head of Aon\'s Catastrophe Insight, said: ""Global natural catastrophes killed many people and caused significant structural and economic damage during the first nine months of 2023. Wildfire and Severe Convective Storm were once again highly prominent, and Aon\'s research reveals that both are becoming increasingly costly to insurers, communities and governments. In the U.S., around 80% of SCS loss growth can be explained by exposure change – highlighting the need for insurers to understand underlying exposures in their portfolios.""Aon\'s research about the drivers of severe convective storm (SCS) insured losses is available here.

The capital was provided by GT Investment Partners (""Ghost Tree Partners"") and facilitated by insurance and valuation services provided by Aon plc (NYSE: AON), the financing will help drive Position Imaging’s growth into the retail, hospitality, and travel markets while expanding into the EU with its global partners network. Position Imaging’s Smart Package Room® and iPickup® platforms are poised to change how first and last mile ecommerce fulfillment operates, with self-service operations without inefficient, expensive alternatives like staff, lockers or robots.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231019360717/en/An iPickup Solution - iPickup UPS Access Point (Photo: Business Wire)The Smart Package Room solution is a new package management system created by Position Imaging. This innovation uses proprietary AI-based computer vision developed by the company to track packages as they are delivered into rooms at multi-family residences, college campuses, and at office locations. Smart Package Room enables self-service drop-off and pickup, enabling staff to focus on more important work to improve operations vs. managing package deliveries and pickups. The system optimizes space better than antiquated legacy solutions like lockers that lose over half their capacity to metal and inaccurate package-to-compartment staging. The systems also scale easily to accommodate increases in package/product volume.iPickup is a new platform from Position Imaging based on the same self-serve tracking technology used in Smart Package Room solution but is focused on eCommerce fulfillment for retail brick and mortar stores. The company launched its first unmanned iPickup Point for PUDO (Pick Up Drop Off) Access Points with UPS this year in the UK. and is now expanding into the EU, starting with a large retailer in France in Q4, 2023. iPickup can revolutionize how organizations manage product and package fulfillment by empowering operations with less staff, improving customer experiences with minimal to no wait times, and allowing a better use of space within stores. The iPickup platform can also provide transformational service capabilities for retailers by combining BOPIS (Buy Online Pickup In Store), BORIS (Buy Online Return In Store), and even shipping. This is a one stop shop solution for retailers that promises to solve their eCommerce fulfillment challenges while helping drive more foot traffic into the stores with expected 40+% upsell rates.Story continuesThese innovative solutions usher in a new age of product and package fulfillment by outsourcing the labor to the customer, saving organizations cost and improving the space required for fulfillment operations. The technologies built into this new platform represent over ten years of development and feature some of the most advanced tracking techniques ever created. ""When we started on this journey, most people scoffed at the notion of letting a computer manage and secure package deliveries vs. a human or a locker. Today, after over 2 million successful self-serve package transactions without theft, we have proven this new AI-based approach works better than the old way of managing deliveries,"" said Ned Hill, CEO of Position Imaging. ""Position Imaging has proven this new approach is extremely effective with a clear market fit and we are now ready to expand quickly. We are thrilled to work with the teams at Ghost Tree and Aon to help this expansion and establish our new platforms as the premium solutions for eCommerce fulfillment around the world.""""We recognized Position Imaging’s technical advantages over existing solutions and the company’s expansive patent portfolio as unique and valuable,"" said David Byrne, Managing Director, Ghost Tree Partners.

Since 2005, over 5 million trees have been granted to more than 1,000 U.S. nonprofit partners and government agencies across the country.“Over the last 18 years, the tree grant program’s partnerships and support of conservation projects stand as a testament to the enduring importance of trees for the resilience and growth of our communities,” said John J. Christmann IV, Apache’s chief executive officer and president. “Apache believes in the importance of building and maintaining this legacy. We are committed to continuing our work as responsible stewards of the environment by conserving natural habitats, expanding shared green spaces, and restoring urban forests.”2023 grant recipients span numerous states and project types. For example, this year recipients include organizations such as Houston Wilderness, Hermit’s Peak Watershed Alliance of New Mexico, and Keep San Angelo Beautiful.Houston Wilderness is an alliance of business, environmental and government interests dedicated to protecting diverse ecoregions along the Gulf Coast.“Having a partner such as Apache Corporation donate trees guarantees an impact in the communities where they are planted and takes on a large portion of the direct costs associated with these plantings,” said Taylor Britt, Houston Wilderness senior director of collaborative grants “The long-term impact of these trees is astounding -- they can remove particulate matter from the air, absorb water, store carbon, reduce urban heating impacts, decrease energy costs and provide shade to buildings. We really appreciate that the Apache Tree Grant Program guarantees the trees are going to be delivered, which provides an incredible benefit to the community.”Story continuesHermit’s Peak Watershed Alliance works to protect and restore the ecological heritage of the Hermit’s Peak region in New Mexico.“With the generous donation of trees we’ve been granted through the Apache Tree Grant Program, we will be holding volunteer and educational planting days that will help to revegetate burned areas of Hermit’s Peak, increase native plant biodiversity and help educate our community members on all of the work we have been doing,” said Sandy Miller with Hermit’s Peak Alliance. “We are proud of all the work we’ve been able to accomplish in the past year and are excited to involve our volunteers and students to continue this work. We are very grateful to programs such as the Apache Tree Grant Program that make this work possible.”In West Texas, Keep San Angelo Beautiful enhances quality of life by maintaining clean, green and beautiful spaces through art, science and education in the San Angelo community.“Keep San Angelo Beautiful is about meeting relevant community needs, creating relationships through intentional acts of service and engaging in purposeful teamwork,” said Charlotte Anderson, executive director of Keep San Angelo Beautiful. “This gives us the perfect opportunity to come together to foster a love of the environment by enhancing it with the beauty of West Texas trees. This year we will have planted a total of 900 trees since 2020 thanks to Apache Corporation. San Angelo is a remarkable community worth preserving and safeguarding, where humans and nature can co-exist in harmony and champion the sustainability of our environment. Thank you for changing the landscape in West Texas.”These organizations represent the wide array of nonprofits and government agencies that the tree grant program supports with a full list of this year's recipients listed below.2023 Grant Recipients:LOUISIANACoalition to Restore Coastal LouisianaIberia Soil & Water Conservation DistrictNicholls State University FoundationNOLA Tree ProjectPontchartrain ConservancyProud Louisiana c/o Parish ProudSt. Mary Soil & Water Conservation DistrictTerrebonne Parish Consolidated GovernmentWoodlands ConservancyNEW MEXICOCity of Las CrucesHermit’s Peak Watershed AllianceTree New MexicoTEXAS Abilene Zoological SocietyAlum Creek Wildlife Management AssociationArboretum San AntonioBayou Land ConservancyBig Bend Conservation AllianceBig Lake Economic Development CorpBryan Noon Lions ClubBuffalo Bayou PartnershipCity of AndrewsCity of EdinburgCity of Fort Stockton - Keep Historic Fort Stockton BeautifulCity of HoustonCity of Pasadena Parks and RecreationCity of PharrCity of SeabrookCity of Spring Valley VillageCity of WhitefaceCoastal Prairie ConservancyDoyle School Community CenterDripping Springs Ranch Park - City of Dripping SpringsExploration Green ConservancyFort Stockton Historical SocietyFriends of the Wildlife CorridorGalveston Island Tree ConservancyHabitat for Humanity PasadenaHarris County Precinct 3Harris County Precinct 4Hermann Park ConservancyHouston Botanic GardenHouston WildernessKeep Levelland Beautiful/Levelland Chamber of CommerceKeep Midland BeautifulKeep Odessa BeautifulKeep San Angelo BeautifulKeep Sugar Land BeautifulKSA Parks Foundation - Trees for KingwoodNative Plant Society of Texas - Fredericksburg ChapterNative Plant Society of Texas - Boerne ChapterNative Plant Society of Texas - Kerrvile ChapterPease Park ConservancySam Houston State University - School of Agricultural SciencesScenic TexasTexas BlossomsTexas Longleaf Team - Texas A&M Forest ServiceTexas Master Naturalist - Hill Country ChapterTexas Parks and WildlifeThe City of Shamrock TexasTreeFolksWebb CountyFor more information about the Apache Tree Grant Program, please visit www.apachelovestrees.com.About ApacheApache Corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of APA Corporation (Nasdaq: APA), is an oil and gas exploration and production company with operations in the United States, Egypt and the United Kingdom.

But when you hold the right stock for the right time period, the rewards can be truly huge. Take, for example, the APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) share price, which skyrocketed 393% over three years.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for APA To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, APA moved from a loss to profitability. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).It is of course excellent to see how APA has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling APA stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for APA the TSR over the last 3 years was 416%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 13% in the last year, APA shareholders lost 1.3% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 5%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with APA , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But note: APA may not be the best stock to buy.

It is faster, in some situations than the T7 SSD it succeeds, and boasts three meters of drop protection and IP65 resistance.Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSamsung T9 SSD review: Best of both worldsThe predecessor to the T9, Samsung's T7, came in several different flavors. Samsung T5 SSD (top), T7 (middle), and T9 (bottom) You could opt for the T7 Touch which was a fingerprint-protected model that helped secure your data with biometrics. Perhaps you valued durability most and could pick up the T7 Shield with its rubberized outer coating. If neither of those were for you, there of course was the vanilla T7 that had a sleek anodized metal body at the most affordable price.Samsung T7 Shield (left) versus T9 (right) When releasing the T9, Samsung decided to omit the other styles and debut the base T9 with a similar rugged exterior to the T7 Shield. There is no bare aluminum version nor a fingerprint-protected version. Heck, Samsung isn't even bringing the T9 to market with any colors. The black we tested is the only color option here at launch.Holding the Samsung T9 That's a little troublesome with the black color, it makes its dust attraction even more apparent. While the T7 Shield had a smooth rubber exterior, the T9 is textured. The texture does add even more grip but causes dust to stick to it like crazy. Shooting the embedded video took twice as long just trying to keep all of the little pieces of dust off the drive. If there were color options, the dust probably wouldn't be as noticeable, such as with a red or blue.Samsung T9 USB-C port Otherwise, one end of the SSD has a USB-C port, which has been upgraded here for the T9, and a mini LED status light. The other end is solid and matte black with some regulatory printing.Samsung USB-C to USB-A cable In the box, Samsung includes both a USB-C to USB-C and a USB-C to USB-A cable.Story continuesSamsung T9 SSD review: Testing those new speedsWith its USB-C port, the Samsung T9 SSD works with devices across the board. Connect it with your Mac, PC, Android phone, iPad, or even the new iPhone 15. It comes pre-formatted as an ExFAT drive though you can reformat it to any other if you so choose. Oftentimes, we'll reformat ours as APFS, especially if using it as a Time Machine backup.Samsung T9 SSD connected to iPad mini For testing, we left it stock with the ExFAT formatting and did not apply any password or encryption on the data. All testing was done on our M2 Max 16-inch MacBook Pro. Samsung says the new drive uses USB 3.2 2x2 with promised speeds of up to 2000 MBps. We tried several different file transfers and tried them both on the T9, and the older T7. We started with a 1.44GB file -- the latest episode of the HomeKit Insider podcast -- and it took two and a half seconds to complete on both drives. Then we stepped things up, moving to a 6.78GB movie file. This time it took 7.86 seconds on the T9 and the T7 was nearly identical.Transferring a large file to the Samsung T9 SSD To finish things off, we moved to a much larger 162GB compressed folder. This one took seven minutes and 28 seconds on the T7 but the T9 took only two minutes and 55 seconds. It begs the question as to why the T7 was just as fast starting but became much slower when we got to the larger file. While this is complicated, the Mac doesn't fully support the 20 gigabits per second throughput on USB 3.2 2x2, so the speed in the T9 on Mac is largely coming from the larger cache. When you get above a roughly 225GB transfer size, though, the T9 will start to slow down as the cache fills, and it hits the slower TLC flash media. The T9 has about a 170GB cache while the older T7 has a 50GB cache. Any files under that 225GB or so will transfer at the best speed possible which varies depending on lots of small files, or one large file, on the T9. In use, the T7 has the same speed as the T9 on the Mac until its 50 GB cache is full.Samsung T9 SSD connected to a MacBook Pro For you to understand, imagine a one-gallon tank is filling and draining water at the same time. But it is filling faster than it is draining. Once the tank is full it can only fill at the same rate as it is draining at. That's roughly how it works with a file transfer. At first, the data can fly, but once the tank fills -- or the cache is filled -- it has to slow down. In the case of the T9, it has to drop down to the slower TLC media.Samsung T9 SSD connected to a MacBook Pro If you solely transfer small files, less than 50GB or so, there won't be any speed benefits on the T9. You may as well get the more affordable T7. For users who are regularly transferring larger files above 50GB, the T9 will see speed benefits. But it, too, will be limited for even larger files.Samsung T9 against the MacBook display When or if Apple fully supports USB 3.2 2x2, there will be larger benefits to the T9.Samsung T9 SSD review: Should you buy the newest SSD?Historically, we've been happy users of Samsung's T-series of portable SSDs for years and are excited about the new T9. With our video production, we're often moving larger files that surpass the 50GB cache of the T7. We may not see the full speed that the T9 can offer, but it was undeniably faster than our T7 and many other SSDs in our kit.Samsung T9 connected to iPhone 15 Pro Max It would be great to see new color options or even an all-metal version for those who don't need or want the rubber exterior. If all metal, we'd have considered sticking it to the back of our iPhone 15 Pro with MagSafe and using it for portable filming. As always, the Samsung T9 SSD is fast, reliable, and is a solid addition to any gear bag.

Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $89.5 billion for the September quarter. We achieved an all-time revenue record in India, as well as September quarter records in several countries, including Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Vietnam and more. iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations, setting a September quarter record, as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China mainland, Latin America, the Middle-East, South Asia and an all-time record in India. In services, we set an all-time revenue record with double-digit growth and ahead of our expectations. During the September quarter, we continue to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including foreign exchange headwinds and we've navigated these challenges by following the same principles that have always guided us.Story continuesWe've continued to invest in the future and manage for the long-term. We've adapted continuously to circumstances beyond our control, while being thoughtful and deliberate on spending. And we've carved a path of groundbreaking innovations and delivered with excellence every step of the way. That includes Apple Vision Pro, which has gotten such an amazing response from developers who are currently creating truly incredible apps. We're excited to get this magical product in the hands of customers early next year. Now let me share more about our products, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $43.8 billion, 3% higher than a year ago, and a new record for the September quarter. This fall, we were thrilled to debut the iPhone 15 lineup.The all-new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous design, powerful cameras and the intuitive Dynamic Island. Powered by the industry-leading A17 Pro, our iPhone15 Pro lineup has a beautiful strong and durable titanium design and the best iPhone camera system ever, including a 5X Telephoto lens on iPhone 15 Pro Max. Customers are loving the entire iPhone 15 family and reviews have been off the charts. In Mac, revenue came in at $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year from the prior year's record quarter. This was due to challenging market conditions, as well as difficult compares against the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Earlier this week, we were excited to unveil the next generation of Apple silicon with our incredible family of M3 chips, M3; M3 Pro; and M3 Max.We're continuing to innovate at a tremendous pace. And our industry-leading lineup of personal computers just got even better. The new MacBook Pro lineup brings our most advanced technology to our Pro users, while iMac, the world's best-selling all-in-one, just got faster and more capable. And according to the latest data from Student Monitor, nearly two out of three college students chose a Mac. We couldn't be more excited about the future. Turning to iPad. Revenue for the September quarter was $6.4 billion. iPad sets the gold standard for tablets and our competitors are unable to match the iPad experience that is enabled by our seamless integration of hardware and software. iPad is also our most versatile product. In classrooms around the world, it's helping educators bring lessons to life, while giving students a window into the world around them.And in artist workshops, design studios and everywhere else, creative minds come together, iPad supercharges the creative process, helping users take their ideas farther than they ever could before. Across wearables, home and accessories, revenue came in at $9.3 billion. Apple Watch has become essential in our lives and this is our best Apple Watch lineup ever. With Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, we're giving people even more tools to stay safe and live healthy, active lives. With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. It feels like magic. Our latest Apple Watch lineup also includes our first-ever carbon-neutral products, a significant achievement of innovation and determination.Apple's unique ecosystem of hardware, software, and services delivers an unparalleled user experience. During the quarter, we also had the chance to introduce a range of exciting new updates to our software that will allow users to get even more out of their devices. Whether it's personalized contact posters and new face time features in iOS 17, new tools for users to make their experience their own in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, or a bold new look in watchOS 10 that lets you see and do more, faster than ever, Apple is delivering an even better, richer experience that users are loving. Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, payment services, and video, as well as the September quarter revenue record in Apple Music.Whether subscribers are waking up to headlines on Apple News+, getting their morning workout in with Fitness+, feeling the beat with Apple Music on their way to work or school, or unwinding at the end of the day with Apple Arcade, we have so many different services to enrich their day. Apple TV+ continues to delight customers as well, with new and returning shows like the Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry and Monarch. We're telling impactful stories that inspire imagination and stir the soul. Making movies that make a difference is also at the heart of Apple TV+ and we were thrilled to produce Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a powerful work of cinema that premiered in theaters around the world last month. We're proud to say that since launch, just over four years ago, Apple TV+ has earned nearly 1,600 award nominations and nearly 400 wins.We also offer subscribers an unprecedented live sports experience with MLS Season Pass. We couldn't be more pleased with how our partnership with Major League Soccer has gone in its first year. Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass have exceeded our expectations and we're excited to continue that momentum next year. With the playoffs now underway, we can't wait to see who takes home MLS cup. And nowhere does the magic of Apple come alive more than it does in our stores. Over the past year, we've continued to find ways to connect with even more customers. We welcomed customers to our first-ever retail locations in India. We also opened doors to new stores in Korea, China and the UK and expanded the Apple store online to Vietnam and Chile. And we have another store opening in China this week.In September, I joined our team at Apple Fifth Avenue on launch day and the energy and excitement were unbelievable. Every time we connect with the customer, we're reminded why we do what we do. From simple joys of creating and sharing memories, to lifesaving features like emergency SoS via satellite, we're enriching lives in ways large and small. And whether we're working to safeguard user privacy, ensure technology made by Apple is accessible for everyone, or build an even more inclusive workplace, we're determined to lead with our values. Our environmental efforts are a great example of the intersection of our work and our values. Across Apple, we act on a simple premise, the best products in the world should be the best products for the world.We've made our environmental work a central focus of our innovation, because we feel a responsibility to leave the world better than we found it and because we know that climate change cannot be stopped, unless everyone steps up and does their part. Our first ever carbon-neutral products represent a major milestone and we're going to go even further. We plan to make every product across our lineup carbon neutral by the end of the decade. And we're not doing it alone. Over 300 of our suppliers have committed to using a 100% clean energy for Apple production by 2030. We also continue to invest in entrepreneurs who are lighting the way for a greener, more equitable future. Through our third impact accelerator class, we're proud to support a new class of diverse innovators on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy.Apple is always looking forward, driven in equal measure by a sense a possibility and a deep belief in our purpose. We're motivated by the meaningful difference we can make for our customers and keenly determined to push the limits of technology even further. And that's why I'm so confident that Apple's future is bright. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $89.5 billion, down less than 1% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over 2 percentage points. And on a constant-currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total, and in each geographic segment. We set a September quarter record in the Americas and saw strong performance across our emerging markets, where both iPhone and Services grew double digits. Products revenue was $67.2 billion, down 5% from last year, due to very challenging compares on both Mac and iPad, which I will discuss in more detail later on. At the same time, we reached a September quarter record on iPhone, driven by strength in emerging markets.Our total installed-base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and many new customers joining our ecosystem. Our Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter. Our performance in Services were broad based, as we reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category. Company gross margin set a September quarter record at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange.Products gross margin was 36.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.9%, up 40 basis points from last quarter due to a different mix. Operating expenses of $13.5 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided, up 2% year-over-year. Net income was $23 billion, diluted earnings per share was $1.46, up 13% versus last year and a September quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $21.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $43.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and a new September quarter record. We had strong performance in several markets, including an all-time record in India as September quarter records in Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia .Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high and fiscal 2023 was another record year for switches. We continue to see extremely high levels of customer satisfaction which 451 Research recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year, driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business, whereby last year we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter and were subsequently able to fulfill significant pent-up demand during the September quarter. We also had a difference in launch timing with the MacBook Air launching earlier this year in the June quarter compared to the September quarter last year. We have great confidence in our Mac lineup and are excited about the recently announced iMac and MacBook Pro powered by our M3 chips.Our installed base is at an all-time high and half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product, driven by MacBook Air. Also, we saw reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad generated $6.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year-over-year. Similar to Mac, these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter. iPad continues to attract a large number of new customers to the installed base with over half of the customers who purchase iPads during the quarter being new to the product and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% year-over-year.We had a September quarter record in Europe and we saw strong performance in several emerging markets around the world. Apple Watch continues to expand its reach with nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product and customer satisfaction for the Watch was recently measured at 97% in the U.S. Services had a great quarter. We reached a new all-time revenue record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. And we're happy to see growth coming from all categories and every geographic segment, which is a direct result of the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem.And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our Services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double-digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high. Also our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from exciting new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to additional storage tiers on iCloud. We believe our customers will love this new offering. Turning to enterprise. We are excited to see our business customers in both developed and emerging markets expand their deployment of Apple products and technologies to drive business innovation and employee satisfaction.Starbucks continuously invest in Apple technology to bring the best experience to the customers and employees, including tens of thousands of iPads across all retail stores to help their teams streamline order management, operations and training. In addition, Starbucks recently refreshed over 10,000 Macs to the latest M2-powered MacBook Air for all store managers, enabling them to do their best work and improve productivity. And in Indonesia, popular technology company GoTo is offering Mac as a choice, so that employees can have the best tools to be most productive. Today, more than half of its workforce are already choosing Mac for work. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $162 billion in cash and marketable securities.We increased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $51 billion at the end of the quarter. And our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $15.5 billion through open market repurchases of 85 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 22 million shares. Taking a step back, as we close our 2023 fiscal year, our annual revenue was $383 billion. While it was down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant-currency basis despite the volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment.Our year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year, and so did our earnings per share performance, as we reported double-digit EPS growth in the September quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency. We are expanding our direct presence in these markets from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile. And we continue to work with our partners to offer a wide range of affordability programs so that we can best serve our customers. We're very excited about the momentum we have in these markets and the opportunity ahead of us. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call.The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point. As a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. For clarity, revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue. Despite having one less week this year, we expect our December quarter, total company revenue to be similar to last year. We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the one extra week.We expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. On iPad, we launched a new iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation during the December quarter a year ago. For the Wearable category, last year we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. For our Services business, we expect the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 45% and 46%.We expect OpEx to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax-rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions.

In every case, the alert stresses that it could yet be a false alarm, but that there is reason to suspect that the user\'s iPhone has been targetted. According to local publication Media.am, the alert means that the receiving iPhone ""has likely been infected with Pegasus spyware, which was most likely installed by the Israeli company NSO Group on behalf of the Azerbaijani government."" Apple\'s alert gives no such detail of who may be hacking, or whether they are using NSO Pegasus. Rather, it warns of any state-sponsored hacking -- or the appearance of it -- and details recommended steps for the user to follow.A typical threat alert email (Source: Media.am) Citing its separate research Media.am claims that ""the use of Pegasus by the authorities of Azerbaijan has allegedly targeted around a thousand individuals within their borders."" ""The number of people targeted in Armenia is expected to be much higher, possibly in the thousands,"" it continues. ""However, it is difficult to get an accurate estimate of the total number of individuals targeted by Pegasus."" In the example notification shown by the publication, the recipient is reminded that he or she has been notified once before and stresses that this is a new occurrence of hacking, or attempted hacking. Media.am says that not everyone reports receiving this latest alert, but for example, ""trustworthy individuals have communicated to us that \'everyone in our department has received it\'."" As previously reported, NSO Pegasus has been used by the Azerbaijan government over its conflict with Armenia. The use of Pegasus by governments has become so common that in 2021, Apple introduced its threat alert systems.', 'AAPLKillers of the Flower MoonThe CEO of the Cinemark movie theater chain says that despite comparatively low takings for the epic ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" Apple is seeing ""real value.""Martin Scorsese and Eric Roth\'s ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" proved to be a box office flop -- despite initially promising early figures -- bringing Apple just $23 million in its opening weekend. That\'s $23 million against a reported $200 million production cost for the film, and an unknown marketing spend. Nonethess, Cinemark CEO Sean Gamble told analysts during the firm\'s earnings call, that both Apple and Amazon are ""very pleased"" with the results of their theatrical screenings. ""There\'s real value they see in this space,"" said Gamble, according to Deadline magazine.  ""[Apple is] really just getting going,"" continued Gamble. ""They had been operating on a slightly smaller level, and now they\'re in business with major filmmakers."" ""They\'ve got three huge releases over the next five months, meaning \'Killers of the Flower Moon,\' \'Napoleon\' and \'Argylle,\'"" he said. ""All are reaching theaters through distribution partnerships with major studios, but unlike \'CODA\' or past Apple films, the trio will spend several weeks in theaters before streaming on Apple TV+."" ""Napoleon"" is due to be released in theaters on November 22, 2023. ""Argylle"" is scheduled for February 2024 in theaters. As yet, Apple has not announced streaming dates for any of these films.', 'AAPLApple ParkApple\'s home city of Cupertino faces losing almost $60 million after California authorities declare that the company\'s tax should be shared across the state.In a move similar in principle to how the EU retrospectively sought to fine Apple over its tax agreement with Ireland, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) is changing the company\'s arrangement with Cupertino. Since 1998, Apple has declared all of its online sales made in California as having taken place in Cupertino. As first spotted by the San Jose Spotlight, this means that of Apple\'s 7.25% sales tax, the local 1% portion goes to the city. Then under the same deal, Cupertino actually returns approximately one third of this revenue to Apple. Consequently the benefit to Apple is clear, but also Cupertino profits because it sees significantly greater sales tax revenue than it otherwise might. ""The CDTFA has done an audit of one of our big taxpayers and has identified that there are dollars being allocated improperly,"" Cupertino Assistant City Manager Matt Morley told the publication, ""and through that audit they are asking for that process to be corrected."" ""The city obviously isn\'t happy with this and we don\'t believe the CDTFA is on base,"" continued Morley. Reportedly, the CDTFA\'s state tax officials have concluded that the city of Cupertino owes it $56.5 million. This is for the period from April 2021 to June 2023, though it\'s not clear how those dates were determined. At the same time, the tax officials are said to have decided that Apple must reimburse the state $20 million. This figure would then be reallocated to other areas of the state. The impact on Cupertino could be significant, but the city is appealing the ruling -- and the appeal could take anywhere from seven to ten years. Even so, the Cupertino City Council has agreed to set aside the $56.5 million to prepare for the potential future loss. Should the CDTFA prevail, Cupertino\'s Morley said non-essential city services could be reduced or even cut. Annually, Cupertino would see a 73% drop in sales tax revenues, and would face having to cut almost a quarter of its operational costs. It\'s important to note that the San Jose Spotlight says Apple has not officially been named in the present discussions. But it also says that sources among the city leaders have indicated that the company concerned is Apple, and others ""have slipped out such confidential information"" during a public meeting. Apple has not commented.', 'AAPLDaniel Eran DilgerNovember 4, 2023 at 5:16 AM·7 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowAAPLApple\'s Crash Detection can and has saved livesOf all the new products I\'ve reviewed across 15 years of writing for AppleInsider, Apple Watch has certainly has made the most impact to me personally. A couple weeks ago it literally saved my life. I\'m not the first person to be saved by paramedics alerted by an emergency call initiated by Crash Detection. There have also been complaints of emergency workers inconvenienced by false alert calls related to events including roller coasters, where the user didn\'t cancel the emergency call in time.  But I literally have some skin in the game with this new feature because Crash Detection called in an emergency response for me as I was unconscious and bleeding on the sidewalk, alone and late at night. According to calls it made, I was picked up and on my way to an emergency room within half an hour.  Because my accident occurred in a potentially dangerous and somewhat secluded area, I would likely have bled to death if the call hadn\'t been automatically placed. Not just for car crashesApple created the feature to watch for evidence of a ""severe car crash,"" using data from its devices\' gyroscopes and accelerometers, along with other sensors and analysis that determines that a crash has occured and that a vehicle operator might be disabled or unable to call for help themselves.More than five hours later I was shocked how much blood was on the back of my ER mattress--and later, how much I saw on the sidewalk! In my case, there was no car involved. Instead, I had checked out a rental scooter intending to make a quick trip back to where I\'d parked my car.  But after just a couple blocks, my trip was sidelined by a crash. I was knocked unconscious on the side of a bridge crossing over a freeway.  A deep gash above my eye was bleeding heavily. I began losing a lot of blood.  I didn\'t regain consciousness for another five hours, leaving me at the mercy of my technology and the health workers Crash Detection was able to contact on my behalf.Crash Detection working as intendedEven though I wasn\'t driving a conventional vehicle, Crash Detection determined that I had been involved in a serious accident and that I wasn\'t responding. Within 20 seconds, it called emergency services with my location. Within thirty minutes I was loaded in an ambulance and on the way to the emergency room. When I came to, I had to ask what was happening. That\'s the first I found out that I was getting my eyebrow stitched up and had various scrapes across the half of my face that I had apparently used to a break my fall. I couldn\'t remember anything. Even later after reviewing the circumstances, I had no relocation of an accident occurring. When visiting the scene of the crash, I could only see the aftermath. Blood was everywhere, but there was not enough there to piece together what exactly had happened.  The experience was a scary reminder of how quickly things can happen and how helpless we are in certain circumstances. Having wearable technology watching over us and providing an extra layer of protection and emergency response is certainly one of the best features we can have in a dangerous world.  Almost always, I find myself in the position of making difficult decisions and figuring out how to get out of predicaments. But in the rare occasions where I\'ve been knocked out which has only happened a few times in my entire life, there\'s a more difficult realization that I\'d be completely powerless in the face of whatever problems might occur.  With the amount of blood that I was losing, I couldn\'t have laid there very long before I would have died. Loss of consciousness and blood is a bad combination for threatening brain damage, too.  I am grateful that I\'m living in the current future where we have trusted mobile devices that volunteer to jump in to save us if we are knocked out.Story continuesWho would opt-in to Crash DetectionLast year, Apple\'s introduction of Crash Detection on iPhone 14 models, Apple Watch Series 8, and Apple Watch Ultra, was derided by some who worried that the volume of false alerts would be a bigger problem than the few extra lives that might be saved by such a tool.  There were false alerts noted at ski lifts, roller coasters, and by other emergency responders who noted an uptick in calls detailing an incident where the person involved didn\'t respond to explain it wasn\'t actually an emergency.  Several observers insisted at the time that the Crash Detection system should be ""opt-in,"" similar to the Fall Detection feature Apple had introduced on Apple Watch to report less dramatic accidents suffered by people over 55.  However, it\'s impossible to have the system only ever working when it is essential. In my situation, I wouldn\'t have thought to turn on a system to watch me ride a scooter a few blocks. I probably would have assumed that a scooter ride was less risky than driving, despite having no seatbelt, no airbag and no other protective gear.  So I\'m also particularly glad Apple doesn\'t restrict Crash Detection only to car accidents! My Apple Watch still works but was scratched up pretty well The fact that my watch and phone had been monitoring me for over a year without incident before a situation occurred where they literally could spring into action to save me is based entirely upon the idea that they are working in the background, not something I\'d need to assume I needed. That\'s the right assumption to make. It literally saved me.  Crash Detection is a primary example of a new, innovative iOS feature update that adds tremendous value to the products I already use, without any real thinking on my part. It just works. And more importantly, it saved my life when it did.Exercise your Emergency ContactsDespite having an iPhone that\'s set up with a European phone number and home address, Crash Detection ""just worked"" here in the United States. It dialed the right number for the location where I crashed, and getting me help efficiently and quickly. That\'s great. However, I realized after I woke up that I had two emergency contacts that should also have been notified. My phone did its job correctly, but in both cases I\'d listed both my partner and a family member with old phone numbers they don\'t still use. That meant that Crash Detection had called the police for me, but wasn\'t able to notify my designated emergency contacts. If you haven\'t taken a recent look at your emergency contact data, now might be a good time to check to make sure that everything is in order. Note that when you update a phone number, it doesn\'t necessarily ""correct"" your defined emergency contacts.  You may need to delete and reestablish your desired emergency contact and their phone number, as the system only calls the specific contact number you\'ve supplied. It doesn\'t run through your contact trying each number you\'ve ever entered for that person. In my case, there was another Apple service that jumped in to help. Because I was sharing my location with iCloud, it was easy for my partner in another time zone, far away, to find out where I had been taken by using the Find My app, and then to call the hospital to find out my condition.  But if Crash Detection hadn\'t been working, I may not have survived-- or things could have ended up much worse: badly injured or even mugged while laying unconscious in a sketchy area in the middle of the night.  I\'m not the only AppleInsider staffer whose life was saved by the Apple Watch, and I probably won\'t be the last. So thanks, Apple!', 'AAPLWatchlistUSB-C ports (plus left, MagSafe, and right, a headphone jack) on a 14-inch MacBook ProTo cut down on warranty claims, Apple has added a background feature with macOS Sonoma that runs liquid detection analysis on every USB-C port on a Mac.Back in 2010, Apple was sued over how it uses moisture indicators on iPhones to determine whether a user\'s insistence they hadn\'t dropped the device in water was true or not. The suit claimed the indicators weren\'t accurate, and Apple lost the case, having to ultimately pay a $53 million settlement. Quite possibly as a result of that, Apple in 2012 filed a patent application for a system to improve its water sensors. That filing specifically noted that it was being done because customers were frequently receiving replacements for products that were damaged in methods not covered under warranty. That was because Apple Store staff could be unqualified, or not have the facilities, to check whether or not a device has water damage. Flash forward to 2016, and Apple has the same idea with iPhones, but also makes it a user feature. Starting in iOS 10, not only could the iPhone determine that liquid had been detected in the Lightning port, it would warn the user. The idea was that the user could then turn off the iPhone and hopefully do so before irreversible water damage.  Now as spotted by 9to5mac, macOS Sonoma has added some similar background liquid detection analysis that checks for liquid in the USB-C ports. As yet, Apple does not use this as a way to warn users to unplug their possibly soaking wet devices, and actually the company does not say what it\'s for at all. But given the company\'s long-standing efforts -- and the wording of its warranties -- water-damaged devices are presumably a significant issue and this is presumably a way in which engineers can detect it.  However, if this is its purpose, the new ""Liquid Detection and Corrosion Mitigation Daemon"" element of macOS Sonoma is only one of the methods Apple can use to detect water damage. The chief one is the use of Liquid Contact Indicators (LCI), which change color when exposed to liquids, and are used across the Mac and iPhone.']"

Applied Materials (AMAT), which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This maker of chipmaking equipment has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9.26%.For the most recent quarter, Applied Materials was expected to post earnings of $1.73 per share, but it reported $1.90 per share instead, representing a surprise of 9.83%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.84 per share, while it actually produced $2 per share, a surprise of 8.70%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Applied Materials. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Applied Materials currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.86%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

(NASDAQ:AMAT) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Applied Materials The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Applied MaterialsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Senior VP, Omkaram Nalamasu, for US$3.7m worth of shares, at about US$125 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$131). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 20% of Omkaram Nalamasu's holding.In the last year Applied Materials insiders didn't buy any company stock.

Specifically, SVP, CFO & leads Global Information Services Brice Hill ditched US$150k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Applied Materials Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Applied Materials insiders own about US$347m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Applied Materials Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Applied Materials stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Applied Materials makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company.

But the silver lining is the stock is up over five years. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 48%, less than the market return of 62%. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 26% decline over the last twelve months.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Archer-Daniels-Midland achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 9.68.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Archer-Daniels-Midland has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Archer-Daniels-Midland's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Archer-Daniels-Midland the TSR over the last 5 years was 70%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Archer-Daniels-Midland had a tough year, with a total loss of 25% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 7.9%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Archer-Daniels-Midland better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Archer-Daniels-Midland   (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about.Of course Archer-Daniels-Midland may not be the best stock to buy.

To skip the detailed analysis of the agriculture industry and organic food and farming segment, go directly to the 5 Best Organic Food and Farming Stocks To Buy.Agriculture Industry AnalysisThe agriculture industry has faced quite a lot of volatility since the Russia-Ukraine war. Ukraine is one of the biggest food exporters in the world. The country’s exports declined sharply in the first few months of the war and resumed once the Black Sea Grain Initiative was signed. The agreement was signed between Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and the United Nations in July 2022 which allowed cargo trips to travel from Ukrainian ports at the Black Sea. Despite the deal, there have been several disruptions along the way. Even before the agreement expired in July, the pace remained below pre-invasion levels, according to a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) report.The latest Israel-Hamas conflict could also shake the food prices and make them more volatile as Israel is a significant potash fertilizer exporter, which could put 3% of the global potash supply at risk, according to Scotiabank. Additionally, according to Chief Strategist at BCA Research, Robert Ryan, Iran’s ties to Hamas and Hezbollah can lead the US to tighten the sanctions on the country. It could disrupt the oil supply significantly after Russia and OPEC made voluntary cuts to oil production this year. If it happens, the surge in oil prices can have drastic effects on the global economy.Organic Food and Farming Outlook and ComparisonDue to the world moving toward sustainable practices, especially when it comes to food and farming, organic foods have started to become more and more popular. According to USDA, between 2010 and 2021, certified organic cropland acres increased by 79 percent and certified farms increased by 90%. The US organic food products sales were around $26.9 billion in 2010 (inflation-adjusted to 2021 dollars) and almost doubled to $52.0 billion in 2021. The Organic Trade Association reported that in 2022, organic food sales crossed the $60 billion mark for the first time, while the total organic sales including non-food products reached a record $67.6 billion. Certified organic food sales accounted for 6% of the total food sales in the US in 2022, compared to 4% in 2020. Organic Trade Association CEO, Tom Chapman said:Story continues“Organic has proven it can withstand short-term economic storms. Despite the fluctuation of any given moment, Americans are still investing in their personal health, and, with increasing interest, in the environment; organic is the answer.”According to the Business Research Company, the global food and beverages market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.3% between 2023 and 2027. On the other hand, the organic food and beverages market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.9% between the same period and between 2027 and 2032, it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 16.7%.Some hurdles that the organic food and farming market faces include the low shelf life of organic foods because no preservatives are used in them. Moreover, organic foods sell at a premium due to their limited supply and higher production costs. Last year’s inflation affected organic food costs more than conventional food costs. Between January 2022 and 2023, the organic fruits and vegetables costs were up 13.1%, compared to 9.9% for conventional fruits and vegetables. In addition, organic chicken costs increased by 19.5% during the same period, compared to a 5.9% increase in conventional chicken costs.Despite these problems, the organic food market is growing remarkably, and organic food and farming stocks could see significant growth in the future. Some of the best organic food and farming stocks include General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA), and The Kroger Co.

Using the most recent financial data, we\'ll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today\'s value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don\'t get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland Step By Step Through The CalculationWe\'re using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company\'s growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today\'s value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.15bUS$2.99bUS$2.37bUS$1.99bUS$1.78bUS$1.67bUS$1.60bUS$1.57bUS$1.55bUS$1.55bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -10.31%Est @ -6.57%Est @ -3.95%Est @ -2.12%Est @ -0.84%Est @ 0.06% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$3.0kUS$2.7kUS$2.0kUS$1.6kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$971US$907US$855(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$15bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country\'s GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year \'growth\' period, we discount future cash flows to today\'s value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.6b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$40bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$40b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$22bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$37b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$71.9, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don\'t agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company\'s future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company\'s potential performance. Given that we are looking at Archer-Daniels-Midland as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we\'ve used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock\'s volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Archer-Daniels-MidlandStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn\'t be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It\'s not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

I'm proud of the team's nimble execution against our strategic plan while adjusting our business model in light of both global macro trends and the evolving needs of our customers. The global market is increasingly dynamic with factors that create both opportunities and challenges for ADM to address.Consumer behavior has shown growing variability, spending more in some categories, while slow in spending in others. And our team has a proven ability to manage through these and the impacts of geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures and the constantly adjusting balances of commodity supply and demand. Within each business, we are focused on navigating these external factors carefully, while we're also building on the momentum we've seen through the year-to-date. As we look ahead, we are on track to exceed our 2023 previous expectations for the total company. In Ag Services & Oilseeds, we saw the accelerated energy transition support strong demand for vegetable oil, leading to a solid crush environment. We leveraged our flexible logistics footprint to manage Brazil's record crop and our Global Trade franchise to best match supply to demand worldwide.In Carb (ph) Solutions, we delivered a record third quarter on the strength of solid margins in starches, sweeteners, and flower, as well as robust ethanol demand that help us drive strong volumes and margins. In Nutrition, Flavors growth continued to outpace the market, while we both grew and executed on our revenue opportunity pipeline. The deliberate productivity and cost management actions we have taken in Animal Nutrition are enabling improved performance as we also see market volume recovery and we continue to navigate pockets of soft demand in certain categories of the Nutrition portfolio. Next slide, please. One of ADM's greatest competitive advantages is the breadth and integration of our business model, reaching from farm to fork.2023 has offered several examples that of how we are creating new areas of growth in each business units. On the farm, ADM has one of the largest and most sophisticated global origination networks, connecting with hundreds of thousand farmer partners worldwide. We have unique and deep relationships with the people and technologies that are shaping the future of agriculture. So as more of our customers are looking for traceable, sustainable crop sources in their own supply chains, we are a natural connector and influencer. We are proud to have announced partnership with PepsiCo, Nestle and Carlsberg, and have a target of 4 million regenerative acres and goal by 2025. The carbon equivalent of power in more than 100,000 homes a year. Moving into production, as the pace of energy transition accelerates, demand for renewables fuel sources is growing rapidly and ADM is in a leading position to capitalize on this trend.With our Spiritwood JV with Marathon currently being commissioned, we are ready to fit the production of a targeted 75 million gallons of renewable green diesel per year. We have announced the Broadwing Energy Project, delivering lower emission power source and a critical part of lowering our carbon emissions used to power Decatur operations. And we're innovating to deliver a new low-carbon intensity products within the fast growing BioSolutions portfolio. And as we connect to the consumer, we're working closely with our customers to serve the challenges of their consumers, whether it's sustainable solutions, the latest flavor or a cost effective ingredient replacement or explore in the future of nutrition through work with ADM Ventures partners like Air Protein and Nourished.And we have differentiated our offerings with the next-generation of evidence-based health and wellness solution. With the world's largest probiotic manufacturing facility in Valencia, more than 50 clinical trials underway and a growing team of deep scientific experts, we are well positioned for the expanding demand for functional foods and personalized nutrition. And to efficiently execute on all areas of growth while maintaining an efficient cost structure, we continue to vigilantly focus on productivity, as well as the culture that let our ADM colleagues bring their best every day. Across our global organization, we're standardizing processes and systems through One ADM and modernizing our operations through digital transformation, driving greater efficiencies while enabling the best use of our workforce and production capacity.Our planned modernization program continues to deliver impressive operational benefits, including advanced analytics and safety improvements across the 17 operations facilities currently in implementation phase. With more than 70 plants in the scope, the planned recurring cost savings associated with automation across our footprint in 2024 is already nearing $20 million per year. Our cultural efforts are the critical foundation for all of these strategic initiatives. We have ramped up our focus on a culture of caring, specifically in regards to the safety of our colleagues. This is our top priority. And our recent performance in this area has not lived up to our expectations. We are committed to taking action to improve and have already begun to do so with the assistance of both internal and external experts.We will do better. By actively managing productivity, innovation and culture and aligning work to the interconnected trends in food security, health and wellbeing and sustainability, ADM is well positioned for sustainable long-term profit growth across new and adjacent avenues. And with the strong performance in 2023 and a constructive expectation for the remainder of the year, we are again raising our full-year earnings outlook. For a deeper look at our Q3 performance, let me hand over to Vikram, who will cover results of operations.Vikram Luthar: Thank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 5. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team once again delivered solid results in an increasingly dynamic environment by leveraging our experience, scale and integrated global footprint. Ag Services results were lower than the strong third quarter of 2022. South American origination results were higher year-over-year as our team delivered significantly higher volumes and margins on strong export demand. Prior investments in port capabilities have enabled us to structurally grow our earnings while capitalizing on a stronger margin environment across the region. North American results were lower year-over-year as a result of the shift of export demand to Brazil, due to the large crop there as well as low water levels in the U.S. river system, limiting volume and barge capacity.Effective risk management, combined with higher volumes and margins in Global trade led to strong results. However, much lower than the record quarter last year. The current quarter also included a $48 million insurance settlement related to damages from Hurricane Ida. In Crushing, we delivered another strong quarter, but lower than the prior year as global crush margins remained healthy, but lower than the very strong levels of a year ago. Our strong results were led by North America, as the crush margin environment remains well supported by structurally higher demand for vegetable oils. We officially opened our new crush facility in Spiritwood, North Dakota to meet growing demand. We are currently in the commissioning process and expected to be running at full rates in early November, adding an additional 1.5 million metric tons of crush capacity per year.In EMEA, we continue to optimize our flex capacity to prioritize crush of higher margin softseed, in line with market opportunities. In the quarter, there were large net positive mark-to-market timing effects which were lower than the net positive impacts in the prior year quarter. Refined Products and other posted another strong quarter, higher than the prior year period, results were led by solid volumes and margins in North America. In EMEA, robust export demand for biodiesel and domestic demand for food oil drove higher results versus the prior year. In the quarter, there were large net positive mark-to-market timing effects, which are expected to reverse as contracts execute in future periods. Equity earnings from Wilmar was significantly lower versus the third quarter of 2022.Looking ahead, for the fourth quarter in Ag Services and Oilseeds, we anticipate strong results that are slightly lower than last year, excluding the $110 million legal settlement in the ag services subsegment from the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect Ag Services results to be in line with the prior year, excluding the legal settlement. We anticipate similar year-over-year North American export volumes, a competitive South American export program and continued strong performance from global trade. We forecast our crushing subsegment will deliver strong results similar to the prior year. We expect robust soy and canola crush margins and with the ramping of our Spiritwood operations higher volumes. We expect RPO to perform well, but be significantly below last year as positive timing impacts from prior quarters are expected to reverse.Slide 6, please. Carbohydrate Solutions delivered an outstanding quarter that was significantly higher than the prior year, enabled by the ongoing optimization of our production and supply chain network. The starches and sweeteners subsegment were higher year-over-year on a healthy demand and strong margin environment across starches, sweeteners, wheat flour and ethanol. Our team generated new customer wins and delivered double-digit growth year-to-date in our BioSolutions platform. As Juan touched on earlier, we also signed a formal agreement with Broadwing Energy to provide lower emissions power to Decatur facility, extending our ability to provide low carbon solutions across the value chain. In the Vantage Corn Processors subsegment, our team executed well in a strong ethanol demand and margin environment, leading to significantly higher year-over-year results.Looking ahead for the fourth quarter, we expect steady demand and margins for our starches, sweeteners and wheat flower products. We remain constructive on ethanol margins driven by solid domestic demand and healthy U.S. exports, supported by lower competing exports from Brazil due to higher sugar prices. We anticipate results to be similar to the prior year period, but with upside potential if the current ethanol margin structure holds. On Slide 7. In Nutrition, strong results in Flavors, health and wellness and recovery in the base Animal Nutrition business were more than offset by continued lower demand for plant-based proteins and persistent demand fulfillment challenges in pet solutions. Flavors reported impressive results in a complex operating environment, delivering a 29% growth in operating profit on a constant currency basis.Results were led by pricing actions in EMEA and strong win rates in North America. During the quarter, we also implemented a successful go-live of our One ADM project in the EMEA region across 18 locations in 12 countries. This represents a significant milestone as we continue to harness digital across the enterprise to drive productivity gains. In Specialty Ingredients, weak market demand, particularly in the alternate meat category, inventory adjustments and unplanned downtime resulting from the recent Decatur incident led to significantly lower year-over-year results. The plant-based protein market has been experiencing destocking and consumer demand softness over the course of the year that will likely persist into next year. Given these recent market dynamics, we have re-scoped our Decatur protein modernization investment project to better match the expected lower growth demand environment.Also, we are leveraging our expertise in creation, design and development to differentiate our product offerings to serve evolving consumer needs. These adjustments will enable a faster pivot to higher growth and more resilient categories such as specialized nutrition, which have synergies across the nutrition portfolio, and we are rapidly building this revenue pipeline. Health & Wellness results were higher year-over-year due to double-digit bioactives sales and a favorable impact related to the revised commercial agreement with Spiber. During the quarter, we realized a significant expansion in our revenue pipeline, reinforcing the demand for evidence-based solutions. In Animal Nutrition, we are beginning to see the cost optimization actions and the expansion of offerings in the specialty feed and ingredient space from earlier this year, driving improved performance.However, the recovery in the base business was more than offset by normalized year-over-year amino acids margins as well as lower profit contribution from the Pet Solutions business. Looking forward, we anticipate flavors to finish the year strong, driven by growth in EMEA and North America. Health & wellness operating profit is expected to finish similar to last year. Animal Nutrition operating profit is expected to continue to recover sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Specialty Ingredients operating profit is expected to be down significantly, impacted by the recent Decatur East incident and demand softness. All in, we now expect full year 2023 operating profit for Nutrition to be around $600 million. While our results in 2023 have been below our expectations, we expect nutrition to return to growth in 2024.We will continue to build on the Flavors momentum from 2023. Health & wellness should maintain its steady performance. The cost actions in the shopper pivot to higher-margin products will enable Animal Nutrition to drive growth, further reinforced by improved go-to-market capabilities. Lastly, for SI, we will work aggressively to restart operational capabilities at Decatur East to minimize the impact in 2024. Slide 8, please. Other business results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to improved ADM investor services earnings on higher net interest income. Captive insurance results were slightly lower on higher claim settlements partially offset by premiums from new programs. In corporate results, net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year, primarily on higher short-term interest rates.Unallocated corporate costs of $298 million were higher versus the prior year on higher global technology spend to support our digital transformation efforts. Other corporate was favorable versus the prior year, primarily due to foreign currency hedges. We still forecast corporate cost to be approximately $1.5 billion for the year. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was approximately 20% higher than the prior year primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings. For the full year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 19%. Next slide, please. Through the third quarter, we had strong operating cash flows before working capital of $3.8 billion. We continue to invest in the business, allocating $1.1 billion to capital expenditures and have returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.We have ample liquidity with over $13 billion of cash and available credit, and our balance sheet is very strong, with an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 0.9. Our fortress balance sheet gives us the financial flexibility to drive our long-term strategic agenda while also returning capital to shareholders and is also a competitive advantage, particularly in a higher for longer interest rate environment. We have completed $1.1 billion of share repurchases through Q3 and expect to increase the pace of repurchases in Q4. Even with the softness in nutrition, and lower-than-expected profit contributions from Wilmar. We are raising our 2023 earnings outlook again and now anticipate full year EPS in excess of $7 per share. Juan?Juan Luciano: Thank you, Vikram. As we close today's call, let me share a few thoughts about how we're seeing our efforts in 2023 position ADM to continue solid progression into 2024. External factors that influence ADM's forward look are closely aligned to the enduring macro trends we have positioned ourselves to be nimble in managing. We continue to see the interconnectivity across food security, health and well-being and sustainability having an amplifying effect across the industries we serve. More frequent extreme weather, extreme weather, geopolitical events and the recent pandemic have all highlighted the criticality of food security within those geographies and for the regions that are served by their agricultural exports.Connected to this, we see areas of supply abundance growing as evidenced by Brazil's record recent crop cycles and areas of need shifting. In some cases, this has resulted in either more domestic consumption in countries like the U.S. or elevated import demand situations where our unparalleled global asset base and deep experience are critical. Government policies beginning to support new demand patterns, whether based on a move to more renewable energy sources or an effort to increase regenerative agriculture supply. Science continues to accelerate innovation in Nutrition with an ever-present consumer interest in turning their food, beverage and supplement consumption to their personal health and dietary needs. Beyond the challenges and opportunities connected to these external factors, we believe ADM is positioned to leverage productivity and innovation to build momentum in the coming year, a continuation of the strategic efforts we have been driving throughout 2023.We anticipate our Services and Oilseeds continue to leverage its extended value chain and deliver structural changes to demand. We anticipate that crush margins will remain healthy while our productivity measures enable us to have a more efficient cost structure. We continue to drive opportunistic extension of our destination marketing scope, grow our regenerative agriculture acres and partnerships, and expand our renewable fuels feedstock production. In Carb Solutions, the compounding effects of our transformative investments coupled with early contracting for starches and sweeteners and what we believe to be a positive ethanol environment are setting up for another strong year in 2024. For Nutrition, we expect continued growth in our revenue opportunity pipeline with significant conversions continuing as we move past some near-term demand weakness.Our expanding results in flavors continue to signal acceleration across our broader portfolio. We expect the positive revenue growth trends in Health & Wellness to drive into next year, and we're already pivoting Specialty Ingredients towards high potential areas like alternative daily and specialized nutrition. Our actions in Animal Nutrition are delivering a positive impact and sustained opportunity growth, which we believe will expand further through the segment in the coming year. And by applying our commercial excellence efforts to this portfolio, we are focusing on the value of innovation in the specialty parts of the business. In closing, I want to express my gratitude to the ADM team for their dedication, hard work and resourcefulness.With the momentum we have been building upon the foundation for growth we have established, I am confident in our ability to continue to deliver solid results as we move into 2024 and continue to pave a path for long-term profit growth. Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions.See also 12 Best Performing Biotech Stocks in 2023 and 14 Best Consumer Staples Stocks To Buy Now.Q&A SessionOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital Markets. Andrew, your line is now open. Please go ahead.Andrew Strelzik: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask about the U.S. crush margin outlook. You commented that you expect crush margins to remain healthy. And I guess this is really a question about 2024 where the U.S. broadcast features have come down. What's your perspective on what's going on there? Do you think that the crush capacity that's coming on is having an impact, or how is that being absorbed? I guess, just trying to frame your commentary around momentum with what's going on in crush? Thanks.Juan Luciano: Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. Listen, our perspective have not changed. If anything, the perspective that we have for the market has been confirmed by what we're saying. Of course, it's a very dynamic environment with the market trying to balance a lot of issues, whether it's more availability of products, more demand, the Argentine situation. We have seen board crush explode back to near the highs recently. And this is just only a reflection of the incredible demand that is coming for soybean meal into the U.S. This drives the board crush has -- it was mill driven maybe before it was oil driven, this was mill driven. You see Argentina situation, they are getting to the end of their inventory. There are probably enough beans at this point for crushers to run until November.So what we see the export book of the U.S. for soybean meal is a record export book from the U.S., something that is higher than over the last 10 years. So I think that, that will continue well into Q1 of 2024. And fundamentally, what has changed, and you have that, if you were island of strong crush margins in the U.S. is this demand for oil. We see crush margins have been a little bit lower for soybean, certainly in Brazil or in Europe, and it’s because some of the oil prices have declined. But in the U.S. with the new demand for renewable green diesel and the new – all the new capacity coming, we expect that to remain strong for years to come. So we will continue to be very constructive at our crush margins in the U.S.Andrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you very much.Juan Luciano: You’re welcome.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Ben, your line is now open. Please go ahead.Ben Theurer: Yeah. Good morning. Juan, Vikram, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow up on Nutrition and the updated guidance calling that roughly $600 million op income for the year. Help us understand if you can, putting that into context to what just a while ago, we've talked about the path to make this business a $1 billion operating income business. What has gone into the wrong direction and what do you still need to correct to bring this business back on track to make it a $1 billion contributor? Thank you.Vikram Luthar: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ben. So let's take it by different business lines. So in flavors, as I mentioned, Q3 had a very strong performance. And if you actually look year-to-date, Flavors operating profit is up 16%. And I think that's been a very important growth engine, and typically, the sales cycle in Flavors tends to be shorter than some of our other product portfolios. So just keep that in mind, that momentum is building and we see that momentum through our revenue pipeline, which is increasing month-over-month, we anticipate momentum in Q4 and frankly, continuing into 2024. The other aspect is EBITDA margins of Flavors is also increasing. It's not just revenue growth. The profit is also as a consequence of EBITDA margin expansion.And finally, Flavors contribution year-to-date overall as a part of nutrition profitability is a little over 50%. So important to keep that as a back of your mind as we think about the future. The second part of the Human Nutrition business, Health & Wellness. Health & Wellness have been steady. Actually, the dietary supplements market, which was a little bit of a headwind has -- we see the destocking tend to see the bit, and we are optimistic about the outlook next year. The other thing that Juan mentioned is the evidence-based portfolio of ingredients is expanding and our ability to apply that into functional food and solutions gives us confidence and that business to continue growing into next year and beyond. Specialty Ingredients. Actually, it's a tale of two cities within Specialty Ingredients.There's a texturants (ph) portfolio that has done exceptionally well because of expansion of margins. We don't talk much about that, but because it's a smaller part of the business, but that has performed exceptionally well this year. The challenge has been on the plant-based protein market. And the plant-based protein is driven by market softness, right? There is a softness in the market, and we've gone down as a consequence of what's happening in the market. What we are doing from that perspective is pivoting the portfolio into some of the more resilient categories like specialized nutrition like or to dairy. It doesn't happen overnight. But remember, we -- through our CD&E capabilities, it allows us to pivot our product portfolio into the categories that are growing, and we will do that.We are in the process of doing that. What happened in the interim is the Decatur East incident. What that's created is a challenge in terms of white flake production for specialty proteins in North America. So that's been a drag that we clearly had not foreseen and that drag is going to continue into 2024. So within Human Nutrition, Flavors performing exceptionally well outpacing the market, Health & Wellness study, SI is kind of in line with market, further exacerbated by the recent Decatur East incident. Then step into Animal Nutrition, what happens with amino acids. We were coming off very high margins in 2022. The good news is, we are going to reset in a much more normalized margin levels in 2023. So therefore, '24 onwards, we won't have that lapping impact of higher amino acid margins.But if you exclude amino acid margins, the base Animal Nutrition business, excluding pet solutions, we talked about all the actions of business is undertaking to optimize costs as well as drive focus on Specialty Ingredients, that is being recognized in performance. We are seeing the benefits of that and you'll see sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. So that, we feel very good about this in Q4 as well as going forward. Ag Solutions, demand creation remains solid, that category has been fantastic. We've had challenges in demand fulfillment in North America, and particularly, we talked about that primarily in the recent acquisition that we did in 2021. Those are still lingering, but we have very clear action plans, and we feel confident that by the end of this year and early next year, we will be able to more than offset that.So all in all, combined with that a new innovation, we feel pretty confident that nutrition will return to growth in 2024. And albeit maybe at a slightly lower growth rate than we had anticipated before. But getting to $1 billion is definitely within the horizon. It may not happen in the next year or in year falling, but definitely in the near term or in the medium term.Ben Theurer: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Palmer of JPMorgan. Tom, your line is now open. Please go ahead.Tom Palmer: Good morning and thanks for the question. The details on the crush moves, I think Andrew's question was helpful. But maybe we could dig a little bit more into what's happening on the oil side. I mean we have seen soybean oil prices come down over the past couple of months. The futures curve does suggest some continued pressure as we move into '24. It sounds like you have plenty of visibility that demand is very strong on this side, but maybe just some color on what might have caused this downward price move and whether it's more temporary in nature in your view?Juan Luciano: Yeah. Thank you, Tom. Listen, North America refining margins are lower in this quarter. I think if you look at last year, the high priced oils were impacted by supply chain disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine war. So I would say this is a more normalized environment. We have also some positive timing impacts due to the pronounced RIN and HVO market movements, pulling forward some of those gains. I would say when we look at the forward quarter, we see remain refining margins to remain strong, but maybe a decline from the elevated highs we saw in 2022 on the early part of this year. Biodiesel margins are also coming out of the highs, as maybe the RIN value component of margin has declined as the industry is building a bank of rings.So we still have not seen a significant pull from the RD demand that it's been building but we maintain our expectation of how much it's going to be built there. So we think that is coming. The other thing you need to think about oil is that demand for food oil is very strong and has rebounded. And there are expectations now that with El Nino, we might have and with the natural maturity of the plantations in the -- in Southeast Asia that we might have a little bit less supply of palm oil and all that. So although, we are coming off the highs, we continue to be constructive about margin stabilizing at a strong level in the RPO area.Tom Palmer: Right. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.Adam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping to -- maybe dig in on the Carb Solutions outlook and maybe if you could just parse the non-ethanol pieces a little bit more. And I think in the prepared remarks, you alluded to kind of a favorable start to contracting in North America sweeteners and starches and maybe elaborate on what you are actually seeing there, maybe better frame kind of the incremental capital investments to come in that business. Obviously, there's a lot of transformation work happening in that business. That's not all much kind of come to fruition in the near term, but better contextualize kind of what the actual level of investment that you've already committed to there, there is? And if I could just ask a clarifying question on the last point on RPO. How much was the timing benefit in the third quarter?Vikram Luthar: About $95 million.Adam Samuelson: Thank you.Vikram Luthar: So on the Carb Solutions question, Adam, I think it's important to just frame it. The liquid sweetener volumes have been steady. And this has happened throughout this year. Almost every quarter, we've said that. So the demand has been pretty resilient, and the margin structure has been strong. The other thing that's actually helpful is strong exports to Mexico as well as higher sugar prices. The specialty volumes in North America have been a bit soft, but with the improved mix and pricing, our margins have actually expanded. The BioSolutions market, we're actually extending into new applications, and that revenue growth year-to-date is 23%. Wheat flour demand has been resilient. The optimization I referred to in my comments, has actually helped improve the cost structure and expand margins.As on all you know what's going on in ethanol. It as goes, the margin structure there is very supportive given domestic demand, blend economics, strong U.S. exports, as well as the fact that we've got a significant -- actually higher domestic driving miles. Now when you think about next year, I mean we're well set up for the Q4 '23, and I already talked about that. It's a little early to say, but based on the strong finish that we anticipated in 2023, and early '24 contracting in North America, sweeter and starches, we are optimistic for solid volumes and our ability to actually maintain and potentially even expand margins in our core starches and sweeteners portfolio. We'll tell you more in our February call, but going in, the outlook is constructive and similarly for ethanol, that tends to be volatile.But right now, the general trends to be supportive of a higher-for-longer ethanol margin environment.Adam Samuelson: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Ben, your line is now open. Please go ahead.Ben Bienvenu: Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody. I have kind of a two-pronged question. One is -- one, you've kind of hit bits and pieces and Vikram as well with the nutrition commentary of the overall business outlook into 2024. The kind of implicit takeaway is, we should still expect kind of very strong and above what, I guess, we would think of as mid-cycle earnings power in 2024, albeit it's early to make that call in 2024. So correct me if I'm wrong there. But two, when you think about allocating capital at this point in the cycle, how does that change, if at all, with what you've been doing over the last several years, and you've been picking up your buyback activity, how should we be thinking about that as we move through this period of time as well? Thank you.Juan Luciano: Yeah. Thank you, Ben. Good question. Listen, we see 2024 with a lot of optimism. We're working through the plan right now, as you can imagine at this time of the year. We continue to see the strength of Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carb Solutions continuing. Ag Services and Oilseeds, we have seen some fundamental structural changes. And I think that that's a multiyear trend. So we're going to see higher crush margins, at least in the United States for quite a while. And our Ag Services business continued to grow around the world in the -- with the strength of destination marketing and that exacerbated concern about food security that bring -- brought by all the geopolitics and the weather events and the pandemic and all that continues and continue to enhance margins for us to the service we provide around the world.So we see that business being very solid and very strong contributor. Carb Solutions, I think that Vikram touched a little bit on the dynamics of the contracting for next year. But beyond that, I think that you have to remember that we are having different uses. We are finding new demand for those products that will do two things, will grow as revenue into new categories like, we're seeing in BioSolutions that is growing double-digits. But it's also going to tighten up the supply for the existing products. So that will be constructive to margins over time, and we've seen that already, so those are the two. And I think Nutrition and Vikram went into a lot of detail into that and all the different pieces. And we're very confident we're going to go back to growth next year.This year, maybe you call it the past that refreshes, we took a pause this year. But the fundamental innovation engine that we have, that's our differentiation. That continues to resonate strongly, whether it's in Health & Wellness in what we are seeing in Flavors or the specialty pieces of Animal Nutrition or the demand generation impact, where the markets are normal and we apply that properly, we are winning more than our fair share, and we're growing faster than the competitors. So we see that with a lot of optimism for next year. When we think about how that correlates to our thinking of how to deploy capital, the priority to deploying capital is in our investment plan, and we have been doing that both in OpEx and in CapEx. Unfortunately, CapEx continues to be higher, inflationary pressure there, whether it's non-power or supply of raw materials, make us take a second look at a lot of the capital.And I think that Vikram has reflected on some of the adjustments that we made, maybe to Specialty Ingredients and other. So we're taking a look at that, and we're reviewing as always in our capital discipline on every project. But we have many opportunities in front of us, and we're going to continue to fund them. We have increased our return to shareholders. Certainly, our cash flow generation is very strong. And to be honest, when we see some of the pivot we are doing even in Carb solution with some of these opportunities, they are not hugely loading our CapEx, if you will. Some of these things where there is the pipeline for decarbonization is with partners, whether it's the LG Chem or other joint ventures are also partnerships. So it's not that taxing in our CapEx budget, if you will.So we think that we're going to continue to increase the return to shareholders. And we've been opportunistic looking at, of course, the M&A environment. And to be candid, we participate in many. We have many items on the fire, but the reality is that valuations have not come down, and we plan to continue to keep our discipline in that regard. So we continue to be opportunistic in that and we look at that. I think Vikram will make a comment on this one.Vikram Luthar: Yeah. I think also in terms of buybacks, good to remind everyone that if you remember in our 2021 Investor Day, we talked about $5 billion of buybacks over the next four years through 2025. If you combine what we've done last year and this year, we've done almost about $2.6 billion of buyback, so we are ahead of that pace. And as I mentioned in my comments and as Juan said, if we don't see compelling valuations and given our discipline, we probably at these trading levels, price levels, we probably are going to buy back a little more aggressively, and you probably will see a stronger pace of buybacks in Q4 as a consequence of some of those factors.Ben Bienvenu: Okay. Very good. Thanks so much.Vikram Luthar: Thank you, Ben.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Salvator Tiano from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.Salvator Tiano: Thank you very much. I want to ask a little bit about the carbonization and the work you're trying to do Decatur. And I think when we -- you were talking about the 7 million tons of you're trying to sequester per year, the idea is that some of these will come from other facilities where you probably need to build pipelines. I'm just wondering, we're seeing a lot of issues with permitting and other issues with CO2 pipelines in other regions. Could this -- could you face similar issues and could this affect the total amount you will be able to request your indicator or on the other hand, could this actually be an opportunity and people that were relying on some other pipelines like Navigator 1 (ph) may come to you and use your indicator wells for sequestration?Juan Luciano: Yeah. Thank you, Salvator for the question. This is a very important initiative for ADM. And it's something that, as you know, we have started like 10 years ago, so it's something that we have a lot of experience in, and we're leveraging that experience and that head start, if you will, in our ability to inject carbon into the lower surfaces in our facility at Decatur. We have a couple of wells there, and we're planning, as you said, to create five more injection wells over the next few years. It is true part of that will be bringing biogenic CO2 generated by our ethanol plants through pipelines. And we are working already in two of those pipelines. We have already submitted permits for all that. Those permits have been accepted.So they are complete. They are in the process of being studied and analyzed, and we are reviewing also with our partners the right of way and acquisitions and all those type of agreements. Of course, as any industry that is breaking ground the pioneer suffer sometimes with the regulatory environment and having to adjust all that. So we're working closely with the authorities across different states and in terms of trying to align the regulatory framework to the needs of decarbonization and to the desires of the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture to have a smart agriculture in the U.S. and decarbonize that. So work in progress, as you said, we have seen the news that you do. And you can take two tax that we might suffer a similar fate or that we will have less competition as you described.At this point in time, we don’t have any bad news to report other than we continue forward with our efforts, and we will update you in the next call.Salvator Tiano: Thank you very much.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Davis Sunderland of Baird. Davis, your line is now open. Please go ahead.Davis Sunderland: Hey. Good morning, team. Thank you for the time and thank you for taking my question.Juan Luciano: You’re welcome.Davis Sunderland: Juan you already talked about it a little bit, but I just wanted to ask if you could expand a little bit more on the ethanol and renewable diesel supply and demand environment, maybe what you're seeing for '24 and beyond? And if you anticipate any incremental changes in consumer behavior over that time? Thank you very much.Juan Luciano: Yeah, Davis. Listen, in ethanol, we think ethanol is going to have a very constructive environment, very high sugar prices are driving Brazilians to produce a lot of sugar versus ethanol, so we're going to have less inputs of ethanol, biofuels mandates are growing around the world, whether it's more ethanol or more biodiesel. So we see Brazil going up 1% per year in that regard. And we see ethanol continues to have very good export. It has a very good value to other [indiscernible] that normally, they go for like $2.50 per gallon. So we have a big advantage around the world. And for people that want to increase the octane in their gasoline. Ethanol is a very cheap [indiscernible] around the world. So the U.S. is the best producer of that, will continue to increase.So you can see export having maybe a floor of 1.4 billion gallons going into 1.5 million. So that's very good. When we look at renewable green diesel, there has been no changes on how we see renewal diesel growth in the medium term, which is to get to around 5 billion gallons in the U.S. by 2025, 2026. Of course, we're a global company, we see that becoming 7 billion to 8 billion gallons by maybe -- and maybe 14 billion, 15 billion gallons of renewable green diesel and SAF online by 2026 and 2027. So we are at the very early innings of all these biofuel demand that is coming, whether it’s again for renewable green diesel or the promise of decarbonization that SAF brings to aviation that it doesn’t have any other valid options right now.So again, we’re going to be a player that speedy good shows that. We’re going to bring 1.5 million tons of capacity that will feed 75 million gallons of RGV. So we expect the others will deliver as we have delivered Spiritwood. So this is an industry we’re building that we’re excited about.Davis Sunderland: Thank you very much.Juan Luciano: You’re welcome.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Haynes of Morgan Stanley. Steven, your line is now open. Please go ahead.Steven Haynes: Hey. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to just ask a question on the guidance. I think previously, you're kind of saying $7 with some upside and now you're saying in excess of $7. So maybe if you could just kind of help us, I don't know, maybe quantify the difference in the two guidances and size, the upside piece would be helpful. Thank you.Vikram Luthar: Well, so I think the first thing to note is, when in Q2, we said around $7 for potential -- with potential for more upside. And what we have seen saying right now is that potential upside is coming through, and that's why we're raising our guidance in excess of $7. But if you step back, Steven, think about what's happened between Q2 and Q3. One is, clearly, nutrition has been softer. We had guided to it similar in Q2. Now we are guiding to around $600 million. So you know, by definition, there's a compensation in other parts of the business. And when you think about the compensation relative to our Q2, that's probably going to come partially from AS&O and partially from CS. And we gave some guidance on AS&O for Q4 and also some guidance for CS.CS to be rough relatively flat versus Q4, barring any continued expansion in ethanol margins, so that could be upside in CS. And in AS&O, we have some puts and takes in RPO in particular, and one went through this. We expect that to be weaker than Q4 of last year just because we expect these mark-to-market timing gains we realized in Q3 to be rolling off. And then in Ag Services, it’s going to be generally flat, excluding the legal settlement that was a onetime thing in Q4 of last year. And then in crush, it’s going to be strong. And I think Juan talked about that we are continuing to be constructive about the cross outlook particularly in the U.S. going forward, given some of the structural demand changes related to renewable green diesel in particular.Steven Haynes: Thank youOperator: Thank you. At this time, we currently have no further questions. So I'll hand back to Ms. Britt for any further remarks.Megan Britt: Thank you for joining us today. Please feel free to follow up with me if you have any other questions. Have a good day, and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.Operator: Thank you for joining today's call.

RNR declined 8.1% since it reported third-quarter 2023 results on Nov 1.

Premiums suffered a blow due to a reduction in net reinstatement premiums, resulting from lower weather-related losses in the quarter under review.However, the downside from lower premiums in the third quarter was offset by strong underwriting results, a substantial decline in expense level and increased returns from the fixed maturity portfolio.RNR reported third-quarter 2023 operating income of $8.33 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.4%.

(NYSE:AIZ) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript November 1, 2023Operator: Welcome to Assurant's Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability. You may begin.Suzanne Shepherd: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2023 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the third quarter of 2023. The release and corresponding financial supplements are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with remarks from Keith and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. Some of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements.Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release and financial supplement as well as in our SEC reports. During today's call, we will refer to our non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplements. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Keith.Keith Demmings: Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the exceptionally strong results we achieved in the third quarter with adjusted EBITDA, excluding catastrophes, growing nearly 50% year-over-year or 19% on a year-to-date basis, both ahead of our expectations. Our results were largely driven by continued momentum in Global Housing and our steadfast focus on executing our strategy, including driving innovation, creating efficiencies and strengthening our global partnerships. These efforts have positioned us to exceed our previous expectations of high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding catastrophes. We now expect adjusted EBITDA growth of mid- to high-teens. Our year-to-date performance highlights Assurant's competitive differentiators, including our advantaged Global Housing and Global Lifestyle businesses that have proven leadership positions with scale and significant cash generation.Story continuesCombined, these businesses are extending Assurant's track record of strong financial performance, thanks in part to the swift actions we've taken across our global operations to improve results and strengthen the business given broader macroeconomic headwinds. We continue to realize benefits from the actions we announced in 2022 to simplify our business and corporate real estate and realign our organizational structure, allowing us to reinvest throughout the enterprise. We extended our 2022 restructuring plan to include additional actions across the enterprise as we believe further enhancing Assurant's operational efficiency will support our long-term profitable growth and value creation. We now expect total restructuring costs associated with our extended plan to be between $90 million and $95 million pretax, above our previously announced expectations of $60 million to $65 million.Looking at our business segments. In Global Housing, I want to thank all of our employees who supported policyholders impacted by Hurricane Idalia and the Hawaii wildfires, as well as several other significant weather events during the quarter. Assurant plays a critical role in safeguarding our policyholders and supporting the U.S. mortgage industry. Our Global Housing adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, more than doubled year-over-year and increased 72% year-to-date, led by significant growth in our homeowners business through top line growth and improving loss experience. Our ability to quickly execute changes, particularly in our lender-placed business, has helped us gain earnings momentum from higher in-force policies, average insured values and state-approved rate increases following inflation impacts in 2022.Our performance so far this year highlights Global Housing's compelling and uniquely positioned portfolio. Year-to-date, including $89 million of reportable catastrophes, our combined ratio is 82% and our annualized ROE is 29%, demonstrating strong returns and cash generation. In our Renters business, we saw continued strength in our property management channel, where policies in-force have grown double digits this year. We continue to win new clients, grow existing partnerships and release new capabilities, including our upgraded leasing agent portal and digital insurance tracking enhancements. We're very pleased with Global Housing's strong performance year-to-date, which reflects our focused execution around streamlined product lines where we have a clear competitive advantage and scale.Turning to Global Lifestyle. Third quarter earnings increased 7% year-over-year or 14% excluding a onetime client benefit within Connected Living last year. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA down 6% versus the same period in '22 has continued to improve throughout the year and is tracking in line with our expectations of a modest decline for the full year. Within Connected Living, we continue to support long-term growth through the development of innovative offerings for our partners. U.S. Connected Living is poised for another year of solid growth, particularly within our mobile protection business, a testament to our breadth of innovative offerings, customer experience expertise and deep relationships with mobile carriers and cable operators. As macroeconomic headwinds have persisted, including impacts from inflation, we've taken decisive action across our global operations to mitigate these impacts.In Europe, expense actions have allowed us to stabilize earnings as we focus on critical opportunities to grow our top line. We also continue to invest to advance product innovation and anticipate our clients' needs as well as improve customer experience through expanded service delivery capabilities. For example, as part of the extension of our '22 plan to realize benefits and simplify our business in corporate real estate, we're consolidating our mobile device care centers into 2 sites in the U.S. We'll move the services currently offered in York, Pennsylvania to our existing facility in Texas. Over time, we'll be investing in a new site in Nashville, where we can leverage a strong talent market and greater logistics efficiencies as we evolve with emerging clients.Turning to our Global Auto business. We're beginning to see initial signs of claims improvement, as a result of the decisive actions taken over the last year to improve performance. These actions included implementing rate increases on new policies across impacted clients and advancing opportunities to improve loss experience for programs where we hold the risk. We continue to monitor claims costs closely and expect improvement will be gradual over time given the way the auto business earns. In auto, we launched Assurant Vehicle Care at over 500 dealers. Building on decades of proprietary data on cost of claims, Assurant Vehicle Care is a comprehensive new suite of vehicle protection products. It was developed to help our dealer partners optimize product design, pricing, training and sales to ultimately enhance attachment and economics.For the consumer, Assurant Vehicle Care provides a digital experience with more vehicle coverage, flexibility and transparency. Now let's turn to our enterprise outlook and capital. Given our year-to-date results and our business outlook for the remainder of 2023, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to grow mid- to high-teens, excluding catastrophes. Adjusted EPS growth is now expected to exceed adjusted EBITDA growth, each excluding catastrophes. This is primarily due to higher earnings growth that now more than offsets the increase in depreciation expense. From a capital perspective, we upstreamed $202 million of segment dividends during the third quarter and $493 million year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $491 million of holding company liquidity consistent with the end of the second quarter.In terms of share repurchases, during the third quarter, repurchases totaled $50 million. This brings our total repurchases to approximately $100 million for the year, including an additional $30 million of shares purchased through the end of October. Based on our strong year-to-date results, we expect fourth quarter buybacks to accelerate from third quarter levels and to be approximately $200 million for the year, consistent with our underlying repurchase activity in 2022. We're pleased with our strong capital position, which affords us more long-term flexibility over time. Looking to 2024, we expect a more modest level of earnings growth in Global Housing, excluding catastrophes, building on strong 2023 financial results, which included $40 million of favorable prior year reserve development.A close-up of a homeowner signing a mortgage contract.In Global Lifestyle, we expect earnings growth to be led by Connected Living, particularly in the U.S. from the expansion of current programs, as we work to gradually improve the auto business, which we will continue to manage closely. From a capital perspective, we're committed to maintaining flexibility for our strong balance sheet and deploying capital for share repurchases and opportunistic acquisitions to support our growth objectives. We will share our 2024 outlook in February, factoring in our fourth quarter earnings, business trends as well as the latest forecast of the macro environment for the year. In the near term, we're focused on achieving our 2023 objectives and setting a path for continued growth and value creation in 2024 and beyond.As we look ahead, we remain committed to execution, innovation and enhancing the customer experience for our clients and their end consumers, particularly as we look to capitalize on growth opportunities while supporting continued momentum. Before I turn the call over to Richard to review the third quarter results and our 2023 outlook in greater detail. I want to once again thank our employees for their hard work and dedication to deliver for our clients. Our company was recently recognized as one of TIME's best companies in the world, highlighting Assurant's strong employee satisfaction, revenue growth and sustainability efforts. Assurant was also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's greatest companies. Demonstrating our commitment to and progress in operating more sustainably.The recognition was timely as we recently introduced Carbon IQ by Assurant. This offering enables clients to see the carbon impact of each device, including new and refurbished devices and provides them with estimated CO2 emissions throughout the supply chain and life cycle to identify opportunities for reduction. We're honored to be recognized for our outstanding culture, products and sustainability all of which help us better serve our clients. And now over to Richard.Richard Dziadzio: Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2023, adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $357 million, up $118 million or nearly 50% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $4.68 for the quarter, delivering year-over-year growth of 67%. To review results in greater detail, let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $192 million in the third quarter, an increase of $12 million or 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, prior period results included a onetime client benefit of $11 million within Connected Living. Excluding the prior period gain, Global Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 14% or $24 million.This increase was primarily driven by higher contributions from investment income and mobile growth. Connected Living earnings increased $30 million or 32% excluding the onetime client benefit, demonstrating strong mobile growth from North American device protection programs from carrier and cable operator clients and better trade-in performance. Financial Services also contributed to the growth. Trading results benefited from improved margins related to higher sales prices for used devices, partially offset by lower volumes, impacted by the timing and structure of carrier promotions. In Europe, we stabilized performance through expense actions, mitigating the impact of headwinds that began in the second half of 2022. In Japan, results were impacted by subscriber decline which is expected to continue into 2024.Global Auto adjusted EBITDA declined $6 million or 8%. Results continue to be impacted by inflation of labor and parts leading to higher average claims costs. As expected, claims experience for auto ancillary products has also contributed to higher incurred claims costs in the quarter. The auto earnings decline was partially offset by an increase in investment income from higher yields and asset values. Turning to net earned premiums, fees and other income. Lifestyle was up by $83 million or 4%. This growth was primarily driven by Global Automotive, reflecting an increase of 6% from prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Connected Living's net earned premiums, fees and other income increased 3%. Growth was muted by the previously disclosed mobile program contract changes of approximately $55 million with no corresponding impact to profitability.Excluding the impact of these contract changes, Connected Living's net earned premiums, fees and other income grew by 8%. The quarter benefited from higher prices on used mobile devices and modest growth in North America mobile subscribers, excluding ongoing client runoff. Turning to the full year 2023. We continue to expect Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA to decline modestly. Global Auto will be down for the full year from unfavorable loss experience, including the impacts from continued normalization for select ancillary products previously mentioned. We've taken decisive actions this year in response to higher claims experience in our auto book, including prospective rate increases and repair cost reduction. While we've seen some improvement, the improvement is expected to take place over a longer period of time given the earnings pattern of the business.In Connected Living, we expect our U.S. business to grow for the full year. Overall, we are pleased with Lifestyle's strong third quarter performance, especially in light of ongoing challenges in auto claims. For the fourth quarter, we expect higher trade-in volumes in mobile, but we also expect ongoing top line challenges in Japan and Europe and investments to support business growth. In terms of full year net earned premiums, fees and other income, Lifestyle is expected to grow consistent with year-to-date trends. Moving to Global Housing. Adjusted EBITDA was $165 million, which included $26 million in reportable catastrophes, primarily from Hurricane Idalia and Hawaii wildfires. Excluding reportable catastrophes, adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $191 million, with an increase of $106 million.Housing performance was mainly led by 3 main items: First, continued top line growth in homeowners from higher premium rates and average insured values in lender-placed as well as an increase in the number of in-force policies. Second, favorable non-cat loss experience across the segment, including a year-over-year positive impact of $39 million related to prior period reserve development. This was comprised of $15 million of reserve reductions in the current quarter compared to reserve strengthening of $24 million in the prior period. And lastly, additional scale within our homeowners expense base ultimately driving stronger operating leverage. Higher investment income also contributed to earnings growth for homeowners. For Renters and Others, earnings grew modestly from favorable prior period reserve development.Growth within the property management channel was offset by softer affinity channel volumes. For the full year 2023, we expect Global Housing adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable cats, to grow significantly due to the strong homeowners performance, driven by top line expansion in lender-placed and favorable non-cat loss experience. In the fourth quarter, we expect higher expenses to support business growth. In addition, the third quarter included $15 million of favorable prior period development. Moving to corporate. The third quarter adjusted EBITDA loss was $26 million, representing a modest year-over-year increase, mainly related to higher employee expenses. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect the corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to approximate $105 million.Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended the quarter with $491 million and dividends from our operating segments totaled $202 million. In addition to cash used for corporate and interest expenses, third quarter cash outflows included 3 items, $50 million of share repurchases, $37 million for common stock dividends and $50 million to complete the repayment of our September 2023 notes. As Keith mentioned, given our year-to-date performance and outlook for the year as well as the strength of Assurant's balance sheet, we expect to achieve full year share repurchases of approximately $200 million. For the full year, we continue to expect our businesses to generate meaningful cash flows, approximating 65% of segment adjusted EBITDA, including reportable catastrophes.Cash flow expectations assume a continuation of the current economic environment and are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance and rating agency and regulatory requirements. In closing, through the resilience of our unique business model, the decisive management actions taken and our intense client focus, we are confident in our ability to achieve the higher full year objectives we have outlined today. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.See also Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks and 10 Best Ad-tech Stocks To Buy Now.To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here."", 'tate (ALL) Q3 Earnings Beat on Expanding Auto Premiums        HOME    MAIL    NEWS    FINANCE    SPORTS    ENTERTAINMENT    LIFE    SEARCH    SHOPPING    YAHOO PLUS    MORE...

A loss of $1.53 per share was reported in the prior-year quarter.Operating revenues improved 9% year over year to $14,583 million in the quarter under review, attributable to a 10% rise in property and casualty (P&C) insurance premiums. The top line missed the consensus mark by a whisker.The quarterly results benefited on the back of continued rate hikes, strong underwriting results and sound contribution from the Protection Services unit. However, the upside was partly offset by continued incidence of auto insurance loss costs, significant increase in catastrophe losses and an elevated expense level.The Allstate Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\xa0The Allstate Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Allstate Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Allstate Corporation Quote\xa0Q3 OperationsNet investment income of $689 million dipped 1% year over year in third quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $640 million as well as our estimate of $678.3 million. The metric suffered a blow due to a 44.5% year-over-year decline in performance-based investment income. Market-based investment income climbed 41% year over year.Total costs and expenses increased 2.8% year over year to $14,518 million but came lower than our estimate of $14,731.6 million. The year-over-year increase was due to an elevated P&C insurance claims and claim expense level.Allstate incurred a pretax loss of $21 million in the quarter under review, way narrower than the prior-year quarter’s loss of $910 million.Total policies in force were 190.1 million as of Sep 30, 2023, which increased 2.7% year over year.Catastrophe losses of $1,181 million soared 54.8% year over year in the third quarter but came lower than our estimate of $1,421.4 million.Segmental PerformancesThe Property-Liability segment’s premiums earned improved 10% year over year to $12,270 million in the third quarter, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,282 million but surpassed our estimate of $12,266.7 million. The metric was aided by rate increases resulting in improved average premiums. While the Allstate brand gained from growth in auto and homeowners average premium, an increase in the number of policies contributed to the results of National General.Story continuesThe unit incurred an underwriting loss of $414 million in the quarter under review, narrower than the prior-year quarter’s loss of $1,292 million and our estimate of $843.2 million. The loss narrowed on the back of higher premiums earned and a decline in unfavorable prior-year reserve reestimates. The combined ratio improved 820 basis points (bps) year over year to 103.4% in the quarter under review but came lower than the consensus mark of 104%.The Protection Services segment recorded revenues of $697 million, which rose 8.9% year over year in the third quarter, attributable to strength in Allstate Protection Plans. However, the metric lagged our estimate of $780.4 million. Adjusted net income dropped 22.9% year over year to $27 million due to increased severity of claims at Allstate Protection Plans. The figure also missed the consensus mark of $58 million.The Allstate Health and Benefits segment’s premium and contract charges remained flat year over year at $463 million in the third quarter, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $449 million. Favorable group health results were partly offset by weakness in individual health. Adjusted net income of $69 million rose 9.5% year over year, which outpaced the consensus mark of $57 million and our estimate of $47.4 million. The metric benefited on the back of strength in group and individual health coupled with reduced operating expenses.Financial Update (as of Sep 30, 2023)Allstate exited the third quarter with a cash balance of $860 million, which grew 16.8% from the 2022-end level. Total assets of $101.2 billion increased 3.3% from the figure at 2022 end.Debt amounted to $7,946 million, down 0.2% from the figure as of Dec 31, 2022.Total shareholders’ equity of $14,593 million fell 16.6% from the 2022-end figure.Book value per common share was $47.79 as of Sep 30, 2023, which tumbled 18.2% from the prior-year comparable period.The adjusted net income return on ALL’s common shareholders’ equity in the trailing 12-month period was a negative figure of 9.7%.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability. You may begin.Suzanne ShepherdThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2023 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the third quarter of 2023. The release and corresponding financial supplements are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with remarks from Keith and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. Some of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release and financial supplement as well as in our SEC reports. During today's call, we will refer to our non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplements. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Keith.Story continuesKeith Warner DemmingsThanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the exceptionally strong results we achieved in the third quarter with adjusted EBITDA, excluding catastrophes, growing nearly 50% year-over-year or 19% on a year-to-date basis, both ahead of our expectations. Our results were largely driven by continued momentum in Global Housing and our steadfast focus on executing our strategy, including driving innovation, creating efficiencies and strengthening our global partnerships. These efforts have positioned us to exceed our previous expectations of high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding catastrophes.We now expect adjusted EBITDA growth of mid- to high-teens. Our year-to-date performance highlights Assurant's competitive differentiators, including our advantaged Global Housing and Global Lifestyle businesses that have proven leadership positions with scale and significant cash generation. Combined, these businesses are extending Assurant's track record of strong financial performance, thanks in part to the swift actions we've taken across our global operations to improve results and strengthen the business given broader macroeconomic headwinds.We continue to realize benefits from the actions we announced in 2022 to simplify our business and corporate real estate and realign our organizational structure, allowing us to reinvest throughout the enterprise. We extended our 2022 restructuring plan to include additional actions across the enterprise as we believe further enhancing Assurant's operational efficiency will support our long-term profitable growth and value creation. We now expect total restructuring costs associated with our extended plan to be between $90 million and $95 million pretax, above our previously announced expectations of $60 million to $65 million. Looking at our business segments. In Global Housing, I want to thank all of our employees who supported policyholders impacted by Hurricane Idalia and the Hawaii wildfires, as well as several other significant weather events during the quarter. Assurant plays a critical role in safeguarding our policyholders and supporting the U.S. mortgage industry. Our Global Housing adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, more than doubled year-over-year and increased 72% year-to-date, led by significant growth in our homeowners business through top line growth and improving loss experience. Our ability to quickly execute changes, particularly in our lender-placed business, has helped us gain earnings momentum from higher in-force policies, average insured values and state-approved rate increases following inflation impacts in 2022. Our performance so far this year highlights Global Housing's compelling and uniquely positioned portfolio. Year-to-date, including $89 million of reportable catastrophes, our combined ratio is 82% and our annualized ROE is 29%, demonstrating strong returns and cash generation. In our Renters business, we saw continued strength in our property management channel, where policies in-force have grown double digits this year. We continue to win new clients, grow existing partnerships and release new capabilities, including our upgraded leasing agent portal and digital insurance tracking enhancements.We're very pleased with Global Housing's strong performance year-to-date, which reflects our focused execution around streamlined product lines where we have a clear competitive advantage and scale. Turning to Global Lifestyle. Third quarter earnings increased 7% year-over-year or 14% excluding a onetime client benefit within Connected Living last year. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA down 6% versus the same period in '22 has continued to improve throughout the year and is tracking in line with our expectations of a modest decline for the full year. Within Connected Living, we continue to support long-term growth through the development of innovative offerings for our partners. U.S. Connected Living is poised for another year of solid growth, particularly within our mobile protection business, a testament to our breadth of innovative offerings, customer experience expertise and deep relationships with mobile carriers and cable operators. As macroeconomic headwinds have persisted, including impacts from inflation, we've taken decisive action across our global operations to mitigate these impacts. In Europe, expense actions have allowed us to stabilize earnings as we focus on critical opportunities to grow our top line. We also continue to invest to advance product innovation and anticipate our clients' needs as well as improve customer experience through expanded service delivery capabilities. For example, as part of the extension of our '22 plan to realize benefits and simplify our business in corporate real estate, we're consolidating our mobile device care centers into 2 sites in the U.S. We'll move the services currently offered in York, Pennsylvania to our existing facility in Texas. Over time, we'll be investing in a new site in Nashville, where we can leverage a strong talent market and greater logistics efficiencies as we evolve with emerging clients. Turning to our Global Auto business. We're beginning to see initial signs of claims improvement, as a result of the decisive actions taken over the last year to improve performance. These actions included implementing rate increases on new policies across impacted clients and advancing opportunities to improve loss experience for programs where we hold the risk. We continue to monitor claims costs closely and expect improvement will be gradual over time given the way the auto business earns. In auto, we launched Assurant Vehicle Care at over 500 dealers. Building on decades of proprietary data on cost of claims, Assurant Vehicle Care is a comprehensive new suite of vehicle protection products. It was developed to help our dealer partners optimize product design, pricing, training and sales to ultimately enhance attachment and economics. For the consumer, Assurant Vehicle Care provides a digital experience with more vehicle coverage, flexibility and transparency. Now let's turn to our enterprise outlook and capital. Given our year-to-date results and our business outlook for the remainder of 2023, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to grow mid- to high-teens, excluding catastrophes. Adjusted EPS growth is now expected to exceed adjusted EBITDA growth, each excluding catastrophes. This is primarily due to higher earnings growth that now more than offsets the increase in depreciation expense. From a capital perspective, we upstreamed $202 million of segment dividends during the third quarter and $493 million year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $491 million of holding company liquidity consistent with the end of the second quarter. In terms of share repurchases, during the third quarter, repurchases totaled $50 million. This brings our total repurchases to approximately $100 million for the year, including an additional $30 million of shares purchased through the end of October. Based on our strong year-to-date results, we expect fourth quarter buybacks to accelerate from third quarter levels and to be approximately $200 million for the year, consistent with our underlying repurchase activity in 2022. We're pleased with our strong capital position, which affords us more long-term flexibility over time. Looking to 2024, we expect a more modest level of earnings growth in Global Housing, excluding catastrophes, building on strong 2023 financial results, which included $40 million of favorable prior year reserve development. In Global Lifestyle, we expect earnings growth to be led by Connected Living, particularly in the U.S. from the expansion of current programs, as we work to gradually improve the auto business, which we will continue to manage closely. From a capital perspective, we're committed to maintaining flexibility for our strong balance sheet and deploying capital for share repurchases and opportunistic acquisitions to support our growth objectives. We will share our 2024 outlook in February, factoring in our fourth quarter earnings, business trends as well as the latest forecast of the macro environment for the year. In the near term, we're focused on achieving our 2023 objectives and setting a path for continued growth and value creation in 2024 and beyond. As we look ahead, we remain committed to execution, innovation and enhancing the customer experience for our clients and their end consumers, particularly as we look to capitalize on growth opportunities while supporting continued momentum. Before I turn the call over to Richard to review the third quarter results and our 2023 outlook in greater detail. I want to once again thank our employees for their hard work and dedication to deliver for our clients. Our company was recently recognized as one of TIME's best companies in the world, highlighting Assurant's strong employee satisfaction, revenue growth and sustainability efforts. Assurant was also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's greatest companies. Demonstrating our commitment to and progress in operating more sustainably. The recognition was timely as we recently introduced Carbon IQ by Assurant. This offering enables clients to see the carbon impact of each device, including new and refurbished devices and provides them with estimated CO2 emissions throughout the supply chain and life cycle to identify opportunities for reduction. We're honored to be recognized for our outstanding culture, products and sustainability all of which help us better serve our clients. And now over to Richard.Richard Steven DziadzioThank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2023, adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $357 million, up $118 million or nearly 50% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $4.68 for the quarter, delivering year-over-year growth of 67%. To review results in greater detail, let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $192 million in the third quarter, an increase of $12 million or 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, prior period results included a onetime client benefit of $11 million within Connected Living. Excluding the prior period gain, Global Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 14% or $24 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher contributions from investment income and mobile growth. Connected Living earnings increased $30 million or 32% excluding the onetime client benefit, demonstrating strong mobile growth from North American device protection programs from carrier and cable operator clients and better trade-in performance. Financial Services also contributed to the growth. Trading results benefited from improved margins related to higher sales prices for used devices, partially offset by lower volumes, impacted by the timing and structure of carrier promotions. In Europe, we stabilized performance through expense actions, mitigating the impact of headwinds that began in the second half of 2022. In Japan, results were impacted by subscriber decline which is expected to continue into 2024. Global Auto adjusted EBITDA declined $6 million or 8%. Results continue to be impacted by inflation of labor and parts leading to higher average claims costs. As expected, claims experience for auto ancillary products has also contributed to higher incurred claims costs in the quarter. The auto earnings decline was partially offset by an increase in investment income from higher yields and asset values. Turning to net earned premiums, fees and other income. Lifestyle was up by $83 million or 4%. This growth was primarily driven by Global Automotive, reflecting an increase of 6% from prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Connected Living's net earned premiums, fees and other income increased 3%. Growth was muted by the previously disclosed mobile program contract changes of approximately $55 million with no corresponding impact to profitability. Excluding the impact of these contract changes, Connected Living's net earned premiums, fees and other income grew by 8%. The quarter benefited from higher prices on used mobile devices and modest growth in North America mobile subscribers, excluding ongoing client runoff. Turning to the full year 2023. We continue to expect Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA to decline modestly. Global Auto will be down for the full year from unfavorable loss experience, including the impacts from continued normalization for select ancillary products previously mentioned. We've taken decisive actions this year in response to higher claims experience in our auto book, including prospective rate increases and repair cost reduction. While we've seen some improvement, the improvement is expected to take place over a longer period of time given the earnings pattern of the business. In Connected Living, we expect our U.S. business to grow for the full year. Overall, we are pleased with Lifestyle's strong third quarter performance, especially in light of ongoing challenges in auto claims. For the fourth quarter, we expect higher trade-in volumes in mobile, but we also expect ongoing top line challenges in Japan and Europe and investments to support business growth. In terms of full year net earned premiums, fees and other income, Lifestyle is expected to grow consistent with year-to-date trends. Moving to Global Housing. Adjusted EBITDA was $165 million, which included $26 million in reportable catastrophes, primarily from Hurricane Idalia and Hawaii wildfires. Excluding reportable catastrophes, adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $191 million, with an increase of $106 million. Housing performance was mainly led by 3 main items: First, continued top line growth in homeowners from higher premium rates and average insured values in lender-placed as well as an increase in the number of in-force policies. Second, favorable non-cat loss experience across the segment, including a year-over-year positive impact of $39 million related to prior period reserve development. This was comprised of $15 million of reserve reductions in the current quarter compared to reserve strengthening of $24 million in the prior period. And lastly, additional scale within our homeowners expense base ultimately driving stronger operating leverage. Higher investment income also contributed to earnings growth for homeowners. For Renters and Others, earnings grew modestly from favorable prior period reserve development. Growth within the property management channel was offset by softer affinity channel volumes. For the full year 2023, we expect Global Housing adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable cats, to grow significantly due to the strong homeowners performance, driven by top line expansion in lender-placed and favorable non-cat loss experience. In the fourth quarter, we expect higher expenses to support business growth. In addition, the third quarter included $15 million of favorable prior period development. Moving to corporate. The third quarter adjusted EBITDA loss was $26 million, representing a modest year-over-year increase, mainly related to higher employee expenses. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect the corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to approximate $105 million. Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended the quarter with $491 million and dividends from our operating segments totaled $202 million. In addition to cash used for corporate and interest expenses, third quarter cash outflows included 3 items, $50 million of share repurchases, $37 million for common stock dividends and $50 million to complete the repayment of our September 2023 notes. As Keith mentioned, given our year-to-date performance and outlook for the year as well as the strength of Assurant's balance sheet, we expect to achieve full year share repurchases of approximately $200 million. For the full year, we continue to expect our businesses to generate meaningful cash flows, approximating 65% of segment adjusted EBITDA, including reportable catastrophes. Cash flow expectations assume a continuation of the current economic environment and are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance and rating agency and regulatory requirements. In closing, through the resilience of our unique business model, the decisive management actions taken and our intense client focus, we are confident in our ability to achieve the higher full year objectives we have outlined today. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question is coming from the line of Mark Hughes of Truist.Mark Douglas HughesKeith, Richard, I really like this housing business, and I'm glad you didn't listen to those people who said you should divest it. Little (inaudible). On the housing business, increased policy count, how much of that is coming from, say, voluntary versus some uptick perhaps in the delinquencies or foreclosures or REO?Keith Warner DemmingsYes. I'd say, first of all, yes, we're pretty excited about the results in housing and it's tremendous amount of work by the team in the last year, and it's really showing through here the last few quarters, and we're building a lot of momentum. I would say very little of the policy growth relates to the underlying economy or REO at all. We're really seeing no change in placement rate based on economic conditions, maybe a little bit of increase in policy count in a state like California, I'd say very modest, but a bit of a harder market. So we're seeing a little bit of growth there. Florida, basically flat year-to-date. So most of the growth is clients and client loan-related mix and nothing yet in terms of the broader economy.Mark Douglas HughesWhat's your sense of the opportunity for sustained momentum, say, in higher values or higher rate? Has that activity peaked perhaps? Or is there still some way to go on both those fronts?Keith Warner DemmingsYes. I mean, obviously, we work on rates related to that product line consistently state by state. We also have, as you know, the average insured value adjustment that we do in the summer every year. And obviously, last summer, we put a meaningful double-digit increase into average insured values. This year, it was just over 3%, 3.1% that went into July. And then state by state, based on historical performance and expected costs, we continue to work with states. I feel like we still have momentum running through the portfolio. We haven't -- certainly haven't topped out in terms of the impact from the rate adjustments. But we do see it tapering and slowing. Certainly, as we think about Q4 as we head into 2024. But year-to-date, feel good with where our loss ratios sit. In housing, we're 42% non-cat loss ratio if you adjust for prior period development, very consistent with where we were last year. So we feel like the rates that we have are certainly appropriate. And as we see impacts on cost of claims will modify as we go forward.Mark Douglas HughesThen one final one. Your fee income was up in Lifestyle, your devices service were down 20%-plus. I think you mentioned the higher value per device. Anything else contributing to that, just the divergence between the fee income and the device fee service?Keith Warner DemmingsYes. So if we think about that year-over-year, certainly, volumes are down. We saw softer promotional activity in the third quarter, not out of alignment with what we expected. We did see a pickup in the back half of September, obviously, after new product introduction by Apple. So hopefully, that sets us up with what we'd expect in the fourth quarter to be an improvement there. And as I look at that business, we've done a really nice job in driving operational efficiency and automation to continue to improve the efficiency with which we operate. And then as you said, we've gotten higher sale prices when we're selling devices and obviously, we derive revenue based on how well we sell devices in the secondary market. But I'd say there's not much else to report. Profitability, a little bit stronger. But if you'll remember, third quarter last year, we had a bit of a mismatch between expenses and revenue. So Q3 trading results were a little bit depressed last year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt of William Blair.Jeffrey Paul SchmittBack to growth in Global Housing. So PFO growth was 23% in the quarter. And I'm just trying to think through the components. You had mentioned inflation guard was 3%, I think, in June or July, but I guess 12% last year. So maybe kind of a mix there earning through. What's rate at? How much was the rate component? And how much was the unit growth component? I'm just trying to think of the different parts there.Keith Warner DemmingsYes. So maybe I can start and then certainly, Richard can jump in. Obviously, when you look at Housing's revenue year-over-year, it's up meaningfully, $100 million, $103 million year-over-year. All of that is from growth in homeowners, which is up 31% year-over-year in terms of revenue. If we think about what's driving the performance from an underlying EBITDA perspective and Richard obviously talked about the prior period development. If you adjust the development, $15 million this year against adverse development last year of '24, we still see a $67 million increase in our underlying EBITDA. And I would say 2/3 of that is really driven by rates average insured values, which obviously play together, and then relatively stable losses related to higher levels of premium rolling through. And then the balance, maybe 1/3 is split between policy growth, which is up 3.5% year-over-year and then investment income, which is obviously helping with cash yields and more assets being held. But Richard, happy to have you add any other detail.Richard Steven DziadzioYes, sure. Yes, that's exact. And I guess I would add, by the way, good morning Jeff, what I would add is that if you just look at the premium component that Keith just talked about, think about it generally as being 1/3 for each of the components that we've just discussed. It's the increase in rates, average insured values and inflation guard. That's sort of the way to look at it. And the other thing, too, that I would mention is you see -- you heard Keith talk about how much drops to the bottom line. I think that's also a credit to the expense discipline that we've had and the leverage we're getting, and you can see that coming out in the expense ratios that the growth in the premiums and the leverage that we have in the business is really allowing us to increase the bottom line.Jeffrey Paul SchmittGot it. Very helpful. And then in Global Lifestyle, just looking at that benefit ratio kind of continue to move up. Despite rate increases, it was 23% in the quarter, mainly driven by auto, it sounds like. Could you maybe just discuss the pricing strategy there? Like when does that begin? What level of pricing can you get in this market? Really, any detail on that would be helpful.Keith Warner DemmingsYes, I can certainly start, Richard. So if I think about the auto business, I'm actually pleased with the work done by our team. So we started making adjustments to rate late last year. So we've probably been in about a 12-month cycle, making adjustments with clients. We're really on the risk in a meaningful way for 4 or 5 different programs. So it's not the bulk of our business, as we've talked about before. Most of that business is reinsured. So there's a handful of clients that we're working with very closely. And we put rate in place that we feel is appropriate to get the business to perform at the levels that are expected. So that work has been done. It's been ongoing for the last 4 quarters or so feel good about the adjustments we've made. We've had incredible discussions with our clients to try to get the programs to the right level of profitability. We've also been working incredibly hard, not just on rate, but on the claims adjudication process, how we're acquiring parts, how we're thinking about repairs and which repair shops to use when the options are available to us to drive more efficiency, and a lot of diligence end-to-end and very much in partnership with the clients. So as we look at the results in the quarter, certainly seeing a similar pattern to what we saw in Q2. But the good news is we've seen relative stability. The cost of severity on the auto side is up a little bit in Q3 over Q2, but the premium earning through is also up, and we're seeing a modest improvement in the underlying loss ratio when we look at the risk clients. So I feel like we're doing the right things. It's going to take time, certainly, to earn through. But early signs of good momentum at least in starting to stabilize as we look to bend the curve. But Richard, certainly anything else you want to add?Richard Steven DziadzioYes, I think that's exactly right. And in our prepared remarks, we basically talked about it will take some time. The claims adjudication work we're doing and the teams are doing a fantastic job, that's helping us today bend the curve a little bit. We've been able to get rate, which is fantastic. But it's going to take time because we've sold what we've sold in the past, and that's going to run through and then the new rates and the new premiums we're getting, that will come through and help us bend the curve as we go in the future, but it will take some time.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS.Brian Robert MeredithCould you talk a little bit about what's going on in Japan and maybe when we might see a flip there from a growth perspective? I know you said you'll still see some pressures in 2024, and I know you've got the new contracts that are going in. When do we see that flip? I would have thought that was going to be a nice little tailwind for growth in '24.Keith Warner DemmingsYes, sure. We start at the highest level with Japan, I mean -- and I've talked about this before, and hopefully, this comes through. I mean this is a really, really critical market for Assurant. It's a tremendous mobile marketplace. It's the second largest in the world after the U.S. And I do think we are well positioned for long-term growth. That's the fundamental point. We're doing a lot of investing in the market, investing in not just capabilities but also talent. And we're in a really fortunate position today in that we have relationships with every major operator in the marketplace.We don't do all things for all operators, but we've got access, we've got deep relationships. And I think over time, that will bear fruit. I would say, as we think about exiting 2023, we're certainly stabilizing the financial performance in Japan. We've seen some subscriber runoff as we've talked about in the past. I expect that to continue to decelerate into '24. And we do think we'll grow EBITDA in Japan year-over-year, '24 over '23. So I'm really pleased with the hard work that the teams are doing and how we're positioned in the market. But that market is about what is it going to look like in 5 years? And how do we unlock the full potential of what I think we can achieve in that market.Brian Robert MeredithDo you have like a percentage you can give us of how much of the Japanese business is now on a perpetual policy versus, I guess, it was a 4-year policy is what they were?Keith Warner DemmingsYes. So the 4-year policies continue to run down. Certainly, the majority of the business is on an evergreen policy. A 100% of the business that is sold today is on an evergreen policy, but certainly, the vast majority.Brian Robert MeredithGot you. And then second question, just going back to Global Housing. I'm just curious, what are you seeing right now from an inflationary perspective in that business, right? It sounds like it's pretty modest given what your loss ratios are pretty good. But if I look at some of the other homeowners insurance companies, they're still seeing a fair amount of inflationary pressure there. And maybe you can pivot that into maybe your business is a little bit different, and you've got better ways to control those that inflation than maybe some of the traditional homeowners companies?Keith Warner DemmingsYes. So we definitely have still seen inflationary pressure. If we look at the Q3 results as an example, we did see higher severities year-over-year. We did see higher frequencies year-over-year. But because of the rate action that we've taken and the change with inflation guard on insured values, the premiums that we're getting more than offset those increases from a claims perspective. So I'd say that's largely why we're outperforming in this market. And obviously, our team is doing a really good job, to Richard's point, not just on the way we operate claims and the diligence that we work with, but the effort around expense efficiency. I mean if you think about Housing, we've scaled that business -- and it really is a scale business. We've scaled tremendously and our expenses -- operational expenses are flat to down for the bulk of the Housing business. And overall, done a really good job on containing G&A, simplifying and focusing and driving a lot of digital initiatives to drive efficiency. So it's a combination of 4 or 5 things that are coming together to lead to the outperformance. It's not as simple as rate. It's a lot of work across the board over the last 12 months-or-so.Operator(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of John Barnidge of Piper Sandler.John Bakewell BarnidgeYou talked about on the call consolidating mobile service centers to 2 areas. I believe you name check Texas and Tennessee, if I heard correctly. Both are low tax, previously low-cost states. Are there further opportunities into '24 to move businesses or operations in cheaper areas in the U.S. that you're considering?Keith Warner DemmingsYes, I would say that we're not actively considering any other relocations. If you think back to when we acquired HYLA. So go back to December 2020, we acquired HYLA. HYLA had a large facility in Nashville, Tennessee, and then Assurant had a facility in New York and a facility in Texas. And as we've looked at our business model, and we always wanted to have multiple sites for redundancy, certainly in operational resilience, but trying to get back to 2 sites, feels like a strategically the right thing to do for the business. And then looking at geographies where we feel like we're really well positioned from a access to talent, from a logistics, access to clients, et cetera. So it's really more about the strategic decision here than it is purely on a cost basis. And it's trying to have scaled facilities that we can make proper investments in and then obviously get access to the talent. So that's what's driving that change. And we will be actually scaling our facility in Nashville. We're in the process of doing that work now. So we'll be building a newer, more modern and significantly larger facility to support the long-term growth of that business.Richard Steven DziadzioI'd also just -- that's exactly right. Now I'd just add to that, too, is one of the other areas we've been getting some real estate efficiency, if I can put it that way, is on our corporate real estate. We have been either downsizing some of our offices or eliminating some of the offices. And that helps us from an expense base to that overall corporate expense that we have. So that's another area that we've gotten some pretty good efficiency in, John.John Bakewell BarnidgeThat's very helpful. I appreciate that. Earnings growth has been very strong. And my follow-up question, I'm not trying to get ahead of formal guidance coming in February, and I appreciate what you've offered today. But how do we think of reinsurance savings next year emerging on the book that's being run off within Global Housing, juxtaposed against what's fortunately, knock on wood, but somewhat favorable of a cat environment for you this year?Keith Warner DemmingsYes. So maybe I'll just offer one thought and then Richard can speak to the process. But to your point, we've obviously had a favorable cat year to this point, significantly below last year, and we talked about a target cat load of $140 million. We're sitting at $89 million year-to-date. So obviously, that's fortunate from that perspective and we'll certainly look to those statistics as we talk to our partners heading into the renewal cycle and hopefully a little bit of a different environment than we were in last year. But Richard, maybe talk a little bit about how we're thinking about reinsurance.Richard Steven DziadzioYes. Thanks, Keith. Yes, in terms of the reinsurance, it's a little bit early days to talk to specifically about it, but I think you hit it on the head in the question. The market has stabilized in terms of processing pricing, it has stabilized versus what it was in the last couple of years, so we're going into better market conditions. I would say we'll have a consistent approach that we've had in the last couple of years when we go into the market. And as Keith said, we're entering the market, I would say, as one of the good guys in terms of we have not gone up into our past our retention levels to the reinsurers this year for the cat reinsurance. So we walk into the meetings, we'll be there in presenting a very favorable position relative to the reinsurers, where they ended up in 2023.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Tommy McJoynt of KBW.Thomas Patrick McJoynt-GriffithI think you said, Keith said and this (inaudible) for 2024 that you're expecting more modest growth in housing in 2024. Just want to clarify that, that is still expecting growth? And then is that in reference or I guess some terminology excluding catastrophes or including catastrophes?Keith Warner DemmingsYes, great question. So we're looking at ex cat, first of all, obviously, hard to predict what cats are going to look like. But as I think about Housing in '24, I think when we suggest modest growth, there's a couple of things to remember. First of all, a phenomenal 2023. I mean this is a pretty significant recovery year, obviously, a little bit more challenged in '22, but roaring back in 2023. So we're extremely pleased about that. And of course, that trend line can't continue because it's been such a turnaround. But what I would say is we've also seen about $40 million of prior year development benefiting the P&L in 2023. But we still think we'll grow housing even though we've got to grow through that $40 million of PYD before we generate $1 of growth, we still think we'll grow Housing because of the momentum that we see and all the great work done by the team. So that's what we're trying to signal. Obviously, we'll get into the detailed forecast as we come back in February, but we do feel good about how we're positioned, right? Housing obviously is going to moderate, but we've got great trend lines sitting behind us and great momentum. And then as we saw in Lifestyle in the third quarter, although we've got challenges we're working through on the auto side, overall, we're exactly where we thought we would be. We're still signaling down modestly for the year. We are signaling growth in 2024 for Lifestyle, and we'll come back with more details, but certainly driven by the strength of the U.S. Connected Living business, which has been growing nicely for 7 or 8 years.Richard Steven DziadzioAnd just another addition on Housing. We will have something like $40 million of PYD going into next year. So obviously, can't count on that in the future years. So that's something we're going to need to overcome. And as Keith said, it's just a fantastic year we're having in Housing. And kind of the way I look at it, an we look at it inside is we look at it a multiyear journey.So really looking at -- last year was a bit of a tougher year. We turned the corner really quickly in terms of the uniqueness of our business, and we've talked about the inflation guard and the rates and the expense leverage that we're getting. So we are expecting it to be continued rate but at a slower pace. But again, it can -- it's not going to be like this year, it's going to be slower given all the elements that Keith and I have mentioned.Thomas Patrick McJoynt-GriffithMakes sense. And then, Richard, can you talk a little bit about the new money yields that you guys are getting, the duration of your investment portfolio and just how much of the tailwinds of sort of reinvesting over time could be? And then also how that allocates between potential upside for Connected Living versus Auto versus Housing, just kind of how that investment income fits within each of those?Richard Steven DziadzioYes. Thanks, Tommy. And in fact, yields and interest rates have been a nice tailwind for us. It's helping us offset some of the inflationary issues that we've talked about, particularly in Auto, for example. So if you look at year-to-year, our investment income is up about 50% or $40 million. So a really nice number coming through. I would say, in answer to your question, that's probably think about it being maybe 1/3 Housing, 2/3 Lifestyle and in Lifestyle, the bigger component of it is in Auto. What you're seeing in this quarter is really the result of 2 things, and I've talked about it in past earnings calls, it's really -- it's coming from fixed income and fixed income yields. Our assets are up a little bit, but yields are up as that -- as those fixed income maturities roll over and we get more investment income on those, but also cash yields are really high, as you know. Who knows what's going to -- what the Fed is going to do next year. But for the moment, we're getting nice -- real high returns off the cash that we're holding. So nice sort of tailwinds to us, and that should continue as long as rates and so forth hold up. But if rates start coming down, I would say inflation is probably coming down. So we'll get some offset there, hopefully, as well.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our last question comes from the line of Grace Carter of Bank of America.Grace Helen CarterI guess back to the expectations for housing next year. I was wondering if we could maybe talk a little bit about the components of the growth that's expected? I mean even excluding the reserve development this quarter, the underlying loss ratio looks pretty good. And just the extent to which maybe the improvement in the loss ratio and the expense ratio (inaudible) is sustainable or the extent to which maybe they could improve even further just as the recent pricing actions continue to earn through the book. And I guess, just kind of the expectations for the top line, given that presumably maybe some of the benefits from the inflation adjustment and things like that start to decelerate a bit next year?Keith Warner DemmingsYes. No, it's a great question. And certainly, Richard can add in. But when I think about that business, and we've talked about over the long term an expected combined ratio range of 86% to 91%. If we look at where we sit on a reported basis this year looks a little bit lower, but adjusting for the prior year development, it's about 85% year-to-date with a relatively light cat year so far in terms of the P&L. So we're relatively close to that range today, which is good. Obviously, we think that's an appropriate long-term range for the business. We do think rate will continue to come through. But as we've said, at a more moderated pace as we have less of that double-digit AIV earning through and then it obviously comes through at just over 3% going forward, let's call it a more normalized level. I think policy count is relatively stable. But we do think we're well positioned. If you think about industry consolidation and think about the clients that we operate with, we partner with a lot of major players in the space. And hopefully, as the market dynamics move around, there could be some opportunity for us to continue to grow policies over time. So I do think it will be just a moderated trend line from what we saw this year, but certainly still expect strong results in Housing and hence, overcoming the $40 million of prior year development. But Richard, what else might you add?Richard Steven DziadzioYes. I think that, I guess, I would also say that, Grace, when we look at the combined operating ratio, something we keep our eye on. So really a combination of everything we're getting. We've talked about the top line growth, and that would be tapering the expense ratio, we're in a good place with that. I think that could continue, maybe not as low as it is now because we'll always have -- maybe some -- have some investments and so forth. But we're in a good place there. The loss ratio think about 40%, 42% maybe full year, that kind of thing. But even then, it's going to depend on what weather we're going to get. What's the severity, what's the frequency, what are the storms, the convective storms that we had in the spring time. So obviously, that's something that's hard to call. But if we talk about the combined ratio at 86% to 91% with cat, that's probably something that we look to and say, on a normal cat year, we'd probably be in and around that range, if that's helpful.Grace Helen CarterYes, that's helpful. And I guess on the Renters book. We've heard some personal auto players this quarter say that they're starting to see severity trends maybe flatten out a bit. And I was just curious on the affinity partners aspect of that business, if you all are seeing any green shoots there or when that might inflect back to strong growth.Keith Warner DemmingsYes. I think we're seeing maybe early signs of modest improvement there. I'd say it's probably too early to call it, Grace. But definitely, when we look at Renters, really strong performance, and we've signaled this over the last few years in the property management channel. So certainly diversifying our portfolio between affinity and property management, and we actually grew our PMC in the third quarter this year more than we grew it all of 2022. So the team has done an incredible job adding clients, driving attach and leveraging our Cover360 platform. And then to your point, should we start to see an acceleration in marketing relative to auto insurers, then that could certainly provide upside opportunity over time? I'd say it's too early to suggest that we're seeing firm trends, but definitely feel like there's opportunity there as we look forward and certainly in '24. Okay. I think that was the last question. So thank you, everybody, for joining the call. We'll certainly look forward to reconnecting in February. And as always, if you have questions, please reach out to Suzanne or Sean, and we'll get back in touch. Thanks so much.OperatorThank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAssurant, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Assurant, Inc. QuoteSegmental PerformanceRevenues at Global Housing increased 24.7% year over year to $584.8 million. The growth was driven by the Homeowners business from higher average insured values and premium rates to address increased claims severity as well as improved policies in-force. The increase was also driven by the absence of catastrophe reinstatement premiums and higher net investment income. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $534 million and was higher than our estimate of $531.3 million.Adjusted EBITDA was $165.1 million against the year-ago quarter’s adjusted EBITDA loss of $38.5 million. Excluding reportable catastrophes, adjusted EBITDA more than doubled year over year to $191.3 million. The growth was due to lower non-catastrophe loss experience, including a $14.6 million reserve reduction in the current quarter, as well as higher net earned premiums and expense leverage within the Homeowners business. Higher net investment income also contributed to the growth. The figure was higher than our estimate of $155.4 million.Revenues at Global Lifestyle increased 5.3% year over year to $2.2 billion. The improvement was primarily driven by higher net investment income, prior period sales in Global Automotive and an increase in Connected Living business from growth in North American mobile subscribers, partially offset by an approximately $55 million impact from previously disclosed mobile program contract changes as well as runoff mobile programs. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.1 billion and was higher than our estimate of $2 billion.Adjusted EBITDA of $191.8 million increased 7% year over year, driven by growth in the Connected Living business, which was partially offset by lower Global Automotive results.Adjusted EBITDA loss at Corporate & Other was $26.2 million, wider than the year-ago quarter’s adjusted EBITDA loss of $24.9 million. The wider loss was due to higher employee-related expenses, which was partially offset by higher net investment income.Story continuesFinancial PositionLiquidity was $491 million as of Sep 30, 2023, which was $266 million higher than the company’s current targeted minimum level of $225 million.Total assets increased 0.2% to $33.2 billion as of Sep 30, 2023 from 2022 end.

The increase was primarily driven by the factors noted above.Adjusted EBITDA1 increased 185 percent to $330.7 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to strong performance in Global Housing, including $97.6 million of lower pre-tax reportable catastrophes. Excluding reportable catastrophes, Adjusted EBITDA2 increased 49 percent, including on a constant currency basis5, to $357.1 million, primarily due to lower non-catastrophe loss experience and continued top-line momentum within Global Housing, as well as growth in Global Lifestyle to a lesser extent.Adjusted earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, per diluted share4, increased 67 percent to $4.68 compared to the prior year period, primarily from higher Global Housing segment earnings and $5.2 million of one-time tax benefits.Net earned premiums, fees and other income from the Global Lifestyle and Global Housing segments totaled $2.66 billion compared to $2.47 billion in third quarter 2022, up 8 percent, similar on a constant currency basis5, mainly from an increase in Homeowners within Global Housing and prior period sales in Global Automotive within Global Lifestyle.Global Lifestyle$ in millionsQ3\'23Q3\'22Change9M\'239M\'22ChangeAdjusted EBITDA191.8179.47%587.7627.1(6)%Net earned premiums, fees and other income2,105.82,022.64%6,255.06,023.84%Adjusted EBITDA increased 7 percent compared to third quarter 2022, including on a constant currency basis5, driven by growth in Connected Living, which was partially offset by lower Global Automotive results.

Higher net investment income also contributed to the increase.Net earned premiums, fees and other income increased 23 percent compared to third quarter 2022, largely driven by Homeowners from higher average insured values and premium rates primarily to address increased claims severity as well as higher policies in-force. The increase was also driven by the absence of catastrophe reinstatement premiums compared to $34.2 million in the prior year period.Corporate and Other$ in millionsQ3\'23Q3\'22Change9M\'239M\'22ChangeAdjusted EBITDA(26.2)(24.9)(5)%(79.1)(72.0)(10)%Adjusted EBITDA loss increased in third quarter 2023 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, which was partially offset by higher net investment income.Holding Company Liquidity PositionHolding company liquidity totaled $491 million as of September 30, 2023, or $266 million above the company’s targeted minimum level of $225 million.Dividends paid by the operating segments to the holding company in third quarter 2023 totaled $202 million. Year-to-date, dividends paid by the operating segments totaled $493 million, representing approximately 55% of Adjusted EBITDA, including reportable catastrophes.In addition to quarterly interest and Corporate and Other expenses, the company had $50 million of cash outflows related to the payment of the remaining principal amount of its September 2023 Senior Notes.Share repurchases and common stock dividends totaled $87 million in third quarter 2023. During third quarter 2023, Assurant repurchased approximately 360 thousand shares of common stock for $50 million and paid $37 million in common stock dividends. From October 1 through October 31, 2023, the company repurchased approximately 205 thousand shares for $30 million, with $174 million remaining under the current repurchase authorization.2023 Company Outlook6Note: Some of the metrics included within the company’s outlook are non-GAAP financial measures and the company believes that it cannot, without unreasonable efforts, forecast certain information needed to reconcile to the GAAP measures, the probable significance of which cannot be determined. More information can be found in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section.Based on current market conditions, for full-year 2023, the company now expects:$ in millions, except per share dataFY 20229M’232023 Outlook6Adjusted EBITDA, ex. reportable catastrophes21,128.3986.9Mid- to high-teens growthAdjusted earnings, ex. reportable catastrophes, per diluted share4$13.61$12.25Growth rate to exceed Adjusted EBITDA, ex. reportable catastrophesAdjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes6, to increase by mid- to high-teens, as significant growth in Global Housing is partially offset by a modest decline in Global Lifestyle.Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes6, to grow significantly, driven by strong performance in Homeowners reflecting higher lender-placed net earned premiums, improving non-catastrophe loss experience including favorable prior period reserve development, and continued expense savings.Global Lifestyle Adjusted EBITDA, to decline modestly, largely driven by Global Automotive from elevated claims costs and lower contributions within Asia Pacific, including softer volumes and the impact of foreign exchange.

Assurant’s non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Because Assurant’s calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant’s non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.(1)Assurant uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important measure of the company’s operating performance. Assurant defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income, excluding net realized losses (gains) on investments and fair value changes to equity securities, non-core operations, restructuring costs related to strategic exit activities, Assurant Health runoff operations, interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, as well as other highly variable or unusual items. The company believes this metric provides investors with an important measure of the company’s operating performance because it excludes items that do not represent the ongoing operations of the company, and therefore (i) enhances management’s and investors’ ability to analyze the ongoing operations of its businesses and (ii) facilitates comparisons of its operating performance over multiple periods, including because the amortization expense associated with purchased intangible assets may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing, size, nature and number of acquisitions. Although the company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets from Adjusted EBITDA, revenue generated from such intangible assets is included within the revenue in determining Adjusted EBITDA. The comparable GAAP measure is net income. See Note 2 below for a full reconciliation.(2)Adjusted EBITDA, Excluding Reportable Catastrophes: Assurant uses Adjusted EBITDA (defined above), excluding reportable catastrophes (which represents individual catastrophic events that generate losses in excess of $5.0 million, pre-tax, net of reinsurance and client profit sharing adjustments and including reinstatement and other premiums), as another important measure of the company’s operating performance. The company believes this metric provides investors with an important measure of the company’s operating performance for the reasons noted above, and because it excludes reportable catastrophes, which can be volatile. The comparable GAAP measure is net income.(UNAUDITED)3Q3Q9 Months9 Months12 Months($ in millions)20232022202320222022GAAP net income$190.1$7.3$460.0$208.5$276.6Less:Interest expense27.026.381.280.4108.3Provision for income taxes38.71.2120.245.173.3Depreciation expense25.822.677.664.786.3Amortization of purchased intangible assets18.217.355.651.969.7Adjustments, pre-tax:Net realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities19.127.449.7166.2179.7Non-core operations(3.0)2.939.445.179.5Restructuring costs13.2—18.30.253.1Assurant Health runoff operations0.30.1(7.2)0.60.6Other adjustments(1)1.310.91.919.329.1Adjusted EBITDA330.7116.0896.7682.0956.2Reportable catastrophes26.4123.690.2150.0172.1Adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes$357.1$239.6$986.9$832.0$1,128.3(1)Additional details about the components of Other adjustments and other key financial metrics throughout this press release are included in the Financial Supplement located on Assurant’s Investor Relations website: https://ir.assurant.com/investor/default.aspx(UNAUDITED)3Q 20233Q 2022GlobalLifestyleGlobalHousingGlobalLifestyleGlobalHousing($ in millions)Adjusted EBITDA$191.8$165.1$179.4$(38.5)Reportable catastrophes0.226.2(0.2)123.8Adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes$192.0$191.3$179.2$85.3(UNAUDITED)9 Months 20239 Months 2022GlobalLifestyleGlobalHousingGlobalLifestyleGlobalHousing($ in millions)Adjusted EBITDA$587.7$388.1$627.1$126.9Reportable catastrophes1.189.1(0.3)150.3Adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes$588.8$477.2$626.8$277.2(3)Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share: Assurant uses Adjusted earnings per diluted share as an important measure of the company’s stockholder value. Assurant defines Adjusted earnings per diluted share as net income, excluding net realized losses (gains) on investments and fair value changes to equity securities, amortization of purchased intangible assets, non-core operations, restructuring costs related to strategic exit activities, Assurant Health runoff operations, as well as other highly variable or unusual items, divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The company believes this metric provides investors with an important measure of stockholder value because it excludes items that do not represent the ongoing operations of the company, and therefore (i) enhances management’s and investors’ ability to analyze the ongoing operations of its businesses and (ii) facilitates comparisons of its operating performance over multiple periods, including because the amortization expense associated with purchased intangible assets may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing, size, nature and number of acquisitions. Although the company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets from Adjusted earnings, revenue generated from such intangible assets is included within the revenue in determining Adjusted earnings. The comparable GAAP measure is net income per diluted share, defined as net income, divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. See Note 4 below for a full reconciliation.(4)Adjusted Earnings, Excluding Reportable Catastrophes, per Diluted Share: Assurant uses Adjusted earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, per diluted share (each as defined above) as another important measure of the company\'s stockholder value. The company believes this metric provides investors with an important measure of stockholder value for the reasons noted above, and because it excludes reportable catastrophes, which can be volatile. The comparable GAAP measure is net income per diluted share (defined above).(UNAUDITED)3Q3Q9 Months9 Months12 Months($ in millions)20232022202320222022GAAP net income$190.1$7.3$460.0$208.5$276.6Adjustments, pre-tax:Net realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities19.127.449.7166.2179.7Amortization of purchased intangible assets18.217.355.651.969.7Non-core operations(3.0)2.939.445.179.5Restructuring costs13.2—18.30.253.1Assurant Health runoff operations0.30.1(7.2)0.60.6Other adjustments1.310.91.919.329.1Benefit for income taxes(8.6)(11.2)(29.7)(56.1)(78.8)Adjusted earnings230.654.7588.0435.7609.5Reportable catastrophes, pre-tax26.4123.690.2150.0172.1Tax impact of reportable catastrophes(5.5)(26.0)(18.9)(31.5)(36.2)Adjusted earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes$251.5$152.3$659.3$554.2$745.4(UNAUDITED)3Q3Q9 Months9 Months12 Months20232022202320222022GAAP net income per diluted share(1)$3.54$0.14$8.55$3.78$5.05Adjustments, pre-tax:Net realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities0.360.510.923.013.28Amortization of purchased intangible assets0.340.321.030.941.27Non-core operations(0.06)0.050.730.821.45Restructuring costs0.25—0.34—0.97Assurant Health runoff operations0.01—(0.13)0.010.01Other adjustments0.020.200.040.360.54Benefit for income taxes(0.17)(0.21)(0.55)(1.02)(1.44)Adjusted earnings, per diluted share4.291.0110.937.9011.13Reportable catastrophes, pre-tax0.492.281.672.723.14Tax impact of reportable catastrophes(0.10)(0.48)(0.35)(0.57)(0.66)Adjusted earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, per diluted share$4.68$2.81$12.25$10.05$13.61(1)Information on the share counts used in the per share calculations throughout this press release are included in the Financial Supplement located on Assurant’s Investor Relations website: https://ir.assurant.com/investor/default.aspx(5)Constant Currency: Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. Excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used in the translation of the income statement because they can be volatile. These amounts are calculated by translating the comparable prior period results at the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates used in the current period, and it excludes the impact of foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) associated with the remeasurement of non-functional currencies. The company believes this information allows investors to identify the significance of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in period-to-period comparisons.(UNAUDITED)Constant Currency3Q 2023Percentage change in Global Lifestyle and Global Housing net earned premiums, fees and other income:Including FX impact7.5%FX impact0.1%Excluding FX impact7.4%Percentage change in Global Lifestyle net earned premiums, fees and other income:Including FX impact4.1%FX impact0.1%Excluding FX impact4.0%Percentage change in GAAP net income, including FX impact2,504.1%Percentage change in Adjusted EBITDA, including FX impact185.1%Percentage change in Adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes:Including FX impact49.0%FX impact—%Excluding FX impact49.0%Percentage change in Global Lifestyle Adjusted EBITDA:Including FX impact6.9%FX impact—%Excluding FX impact6.9%(6)The company outlook for Adjusted earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes, for Assurant and Global Housing, each constitute forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures and the company believes that it cannot, without unreasonable efforts, forecast certain information needed to reconcile such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure, the probable significance of which cannot be determined. The company is able to quantify a full-year estimate of interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization of purchased intangible assets, each on a pre-tax basis, and the estimated effective tax rate, which are expected to be approximately $108 million, $105 million, $74 million and 20 to 22 percent, respectively. Other GAAP components cannot be reliably quantified due to the combination of variability and volatility of such components and may, depending on the size of the components, have a significant impact on the reconciliation.Assurant, Inc.Consolidated Statement of Operations (unaudited)Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 and 20223Q9 Months2023202220232022($ in millions except number of shares and per share amounts)RevenuesNet earned premiums$2,357.3$2,197.1$6,965.8$6,502.4Fees and other income310.4294.6888.8942.2Net investment income125.583.5343.6261.8Net realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities(19.1)(27.4)(49.7)(166.2)Total revenues2,774.12,547.88,148.57,540.2Benefits, losses and expensesPolicyholder benefits644.6670.51,922.71,760.5Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses1,873.71,842.55,564.55,444.8Interest expense27.026.381.280.4Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt——(0.1)0.9Total benefits, losses and expenses2,545.32,539.37,568.37,286.6Income before provision for income taxes228.88.5580.2253.6Provision for income taxes38.71.2120.245.1Net income$190.1$7.3$460.0$208.5Net income per share:Basic$3.55$0.14$8.58$3.81Diluted$3.54$0.14$8.55$3.78Common stock dividends per share$0.70$0.68$2.10$2.04Share data:Basic weighted average shares outstanding53,535,98253,717,37353,591,49554,693,799Diluted weighted average shares outstanding53,745,17354,066,60553,824,38455,124,850Assurant, Inc.Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets (unaudited)At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022September 30,December 31,20232022($ in millions)AssetsInvestments and cash and cash equivalents$9,348.0$9,061.2Reinsurance recoverables6,683.86,999.4Deferred acquisition costs9,903.89,677.1Goodwill2,605.22,603.0Value of business acquired124.7262.8Other assets4,543.34,513.8Total assets$33,208.8$33,117.3LiabilitiesPolicyholder benefits and claims payable$2,521.8$2,717.9Unearned premiums20,119.919,802.4Debt2,080.02,129.9Accounts payable and other liabilities3,996.54,238.4Total liabilities28,718.228,888.6Stockholders’ equityEquity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss5,541.65,214.9Accumulated other comprehensive loss(1,051.0)(986.2)Total equity4,490.64,228.7Total liabilities and equity$33,208.8$33,117.3View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231031747273/en/ContactsMedia Contacts: Linda RecuperoSenior Vice President, Global Enterprise CommunicationsPhone: 201.519.9773linda.recupero@assurant.comStacie ShererVice President, Corporate CommunicationsPhone: 917.420.0980stacie.sherer@assurant.comInvestor Relations Contacts: Suzanne ShepherdSenior Vice President, Investor Relations and SustainabilityPhone: 201.788.4324suzanne.shepherd@assurant.comSean MoshierVice President, Investor RelationsPhone: 914.204.2253sean.moshier@assurant.com']"

Notably, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note briefly surpassed the 5% mark, a level not seen in 16 years, which further contributed to investor concerns. They are now looking more at assets that generate income due to the current uncertainty. A strong income-focused portfolio combines various income-generating assets like bonds, dividend stocks, and real estate. This mix helps lower risks and enhances the potential for steady, long-term returns.Also read: 12 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive IncomeDividend stocks offer more than just income; they create a virtuous cycle of growth. Strong dividend growth is beneficial for investors in several ways. It can enhance returns and act as a shield against inflation by offering a steadily increasing income stream, much like an annual raise in your earnings. Additionally, dividend-growing stocks have the potential for price appreciation because they often reflect a company's improving earnings and dividend payments over time. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, historically, large-cap dividend-growing stocks have shown resilience during market downturns, experienced smaller losses, and performed well when the market remained stable. In addition, they've managed to capture a significant portion of the market's upswings during more favorable economic conditions. The report also mentioned that over the period from 1985 to 2022, companies that increased their dividends within the Russell 1000 Index outperformed the overall market index, and they did so with less volatility.Lower volatility is one of the factors that attract investors to dividend stocks. The reduced price fluctuations in dividend stocks can provide a sense of stability and predictability in an investor's portfolio, which is especially appealing to those who prioritize income generation and want to avoid significant market ups and downs. Wisdom Tree reported that over the past 64 years, dividend levels decreased in just six years, and only once did they drop by more than 5%. In contrast, stock prices experienced declines in 18 of those 64 years, with the worst yearly drop exceeding 40% and an average decline of over 11%. This data suggests that stock prices are significantly more volatile than the cash flows from dividends.Story continuesSome of the best stocks to buy for income include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) as these companies have been making regular dividend payments to shareholders for a long time and have also raised their payouts for decades.

ADSK,"[""ADSKeditorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)November 4, 2023 at 5:00 AM·4 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowADSKWatchlistLegendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Autodesk What Is Autodesk's Net Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Autodesk had US$2.28b of debt in July 2023, down from US$2.63b, one year before. On the flip side, it has US$2.07b in cash leading to net debt of about US$209.0m.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Autodesk's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Autodesk had liabilities of US$3.88b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$4.03b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$2.07b as well as receivables valued at US$402.0m due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$5.43b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Since publicly traded Autodesk shares are worth a very impressive total of US$43.6b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward. Carrying virtually no net debt, Autodesk has a very light debt load indeed.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Autodesk has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.19. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 95.3 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. Also good is that Autodesk grew its EBIT at 19% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Autodesk can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Autodesk actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.Our ViewAutodesk's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Considering this range of factors, it seems to us that Autodesk is quite prudent with its debt, and the risks seem well managed. So we're not worried about the use of a little leverage on the balance sheet. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Autodesk , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Autodesk:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$1.0b ÷ (US$9.1b - US$3.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Therefore, Autodesk has an ROCE of 20%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Software industry average of 8.5%. View our latest analysis for Autodesk roceIn the above chart we have measured Autodesk's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Autodesk here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEThe fact that Autodesk is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making five years ago but is is now generating 20% on its capital. In addition to that, Autodesk is employing 173% more capital than previously which is expected of a company that's trying to break into profitability. We like this trend, because it tells us the company has profitable reinvestment opportunities available to it, and if it continues going forward that can lead to a multi-bagger performance.Story continuesOn a side note, Autodesk's current liabilities are still rather high at 43% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.The Bottom Line On Autodesk's ROCELong story short, we're delighted to see that Autodesk's reinvestment activities have paid off and the company is now profitable. And with a respectable 46% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Autodesk that you might find interesting.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:ADSK) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$222 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$199. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Autodesk's current trading price of US$200 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Autodesk’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Autodesk What Is Autodesk Worth?Good news, investors! Autodesk is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $273.17, but it is currently trading at US$200 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Autodesk’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Autodesk?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 87% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Autodesk. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since ADSK is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADSK for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ADSK. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you want to dive deeper into Autodesk, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

Here’s how it’s goingRead full articleElisabeth Buchwald, CNNOctober 24, 2023 at 5:51 AM·8 min readBig Tech has given workers an ultimatum: Come back to the office, or find a new job.Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and a host of other leaders of America’s biggest companies have made it clear that their success hinges upon everyone working in person.Autodesk isn’t giving in to the peer pressure. But when peer pressure comes from some of the most successful companies, it’s a big risk to swim against the tide, and it usually doesn’t end well.That didn’t deter Rebecca Pearce, chief people officer at Autodesk, from experimenting with a different approach.Under her leadership, in March, Autodesk, a multinational software company that makes tools for architects and designers, unveiled a hybrid-centric approach dubbed Flex Forward. Under the new program, managers hold the reins. They decide when — or if — employees need to come in to the office.The woman who advocated for itBritish-born human relations executive Pearce was one of the loudest voices at C-suite level meetings advocating for Flex Forward.“I’m cursed with being a futuristic optimist,” Pearce, who is based in Cornwall, England, told CNN.Having spent most of her career in hybrid working arrangements across the globe, she knew she could be just as productive working from an office as she was working from anywhere else.At the same time, she and other Autodesk executives wanted workers to come in to their offices, recognizing how important face-to-face interactions are for employees and for the company as a whole.Rebecca Pearce, the chief people officer at Autodesk. - Courtesy Autodesk Inc.“There are some things that are just done better in person,” said Pearce, who became Autodesk’s interim chief people officer in January 2021 while the company searched for a permanent replacement for its prior CPO, who stepped down.Pearce never expected to be considered for her role because no prior C-suite executive at Autodesk before her lived outside of North America, she said. “There were times when I just felt a huge sense of responsibility to prove that flexible working can work even at the most senior levels within the organization.”Story continuesAt the same time, Pearce faced little opposition when she made her case for Flex Forward, said Steve Blum, Autodesk’s chief operating officer, noting that Pearce makes every effort to listen to employees’ concerns throughout any decision-making process.“Everyone knows when she presents anything, it’s always been what’s in the best interest of the company,” he told CNN.The strategy: Getting workers to come in of their own volitionAfter shuttering more than 90 offices worldwide in March 2020, Autodesk gradually began reopening for optional use in 2021 at different times, based on local regulations. But the company’s 13,000 employees weren’t in a rush to return.Outside of Autodesk, it didn’t take too long for return-to-office mandates to start piling up.Tesla CEO Elon Musk ruffled quite a few feathers when he announced employees would be required to work in person five days a week in June 2022.“There are of course companies that don’t require this, but when was the last time they shipped a great new product? It’s been a while,” Musk wrote in a company-wide email. Those who don’t like the policy “should pretend to work somewhere else,” Musk said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.But many companies have followed suit.“Our early analysis of performance data suggests that engineers who either joined Meta in-person and then transferred to remote or remained in-person performed better on average than people who joined remotely,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a March blog post. “This analysis also shows that engineers earlier in their career perform better on average when they work in-person with teammates at least three days a week.”JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has made the case for a broader return to work, saying his firm has seen ""alienation"" among younger workers and that an extended stretch of working from home could bring long-term economic and social damage. - Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAround 60% of JPMorgan Chase’s workforce — including all managing directors — are working in person five days a week, CEO Jamie Dimon said in July. “I do not believe you can be a leader and not be accessible to your people,” he said, adding that remote work “doesn’t really work for creativity and spontaneity.”“When you’re in person, people tend to be more engaged, observant, and attuned to what’s happening in the meetings and the cultural clues being communicated,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a company-wide memo in February. Among the many other reasons he gave for why Amazon would be soon be mandating a return to offices, Jassy said, “collaborating and inventing is easier and more effective when we’re in person.”Autodesk wanted workers back, too. But it took a different approach. Autodesk commissioned a satirical video urging an employee who initially appears to be Zooming in to a meeting to join their employees at Autodesk’s Portland, Oregon, office in April last year.“You should come, you should come,” an office-based employee says in the video. “This office is way cooler than anything you have at home, don’t be a dork,” an employee says to the Zoom employee, who appears to be anxious about coming to work in person again. Then they proceed to show him all of the perks around the office, including massage chairs and free snacks.The video encapsulates the underpinnings of Flex Forward.Autodesk offices in Portland, Oregon, in December 2020. - GDA/La Nacion/AP“We want people to want to be [at the office]. We do not want them to have to be forced to be there,” Pearce told CNN. “At the end of the day, we don’t believe that just being in an office is what helps people to be happy, productive, collaborative [and] innovative.”In theory, letting more than 2,600 managers who work directly with their employees call the shots sounded like a win-win. Autodesk employees were less likely to stage a massive walkout like Amazon workers did in May after the company began requiring employees to return to offices three days a week. The company also presumably wouldn’t lose nearly half of its workforce, which is what happened to LGBTQ dating app Grindr after it announced a return-to-office mandate.However, the program risked letting all employees work from home or any other remote location. And that would have left Autodesk with unused office space and leases that wouldn’t be up for renewal for years.But, Pearce conceded, “we are going to say to employees from time to time, ‘Hey, we think you need to be here for the next few months in person because it’s going to accelerate your success and it’s going to accelerate our success.’”Nevertheless, Pearce was not keen to give the appearance that Autodesk was looking for “an easy way to get talent” through offering such a flexible and attractive work arrangement, she told CNN.Intentional office gatheringsAhead of instituting Flex Forward, Autodesk was “rethinking our office footprint,” Blum said. For instance, Autodesk closed its San Rafael, California, office; consolidated it with the San Francisco headquarters; and started subleasing some of its office space.An office space area that has been reimagined as part of the Autodesk Conference Experience program at the company\'s headquarters in San Francisco. - Courtesy Autodesk Inc.The company also redesigned many of its remaining spaces to shift away from cubicles and individual work spaces, which were 60% to 70% of Autodesk’s office space, to ones that promote more collaboration. Or as Pearce put it, “intentional gathering.”Now, it’s the other way around, which makes it possible for off-site meetings that previously were held at hotels to happen in-office, said Pearce.“It actually is a more beneficial use of the space and a more cost-effective way of doing these meetings,” said Blum. “It’s this constant experiment of sorts.”Pearce has stopped worrying how Flex Forward makes Autodesk look in the eyes of companies competing for the same talent. The results speak for themselves, she said.Employees at Autodesk\'s Portland, Oregon, office in June 2023. - Courtesy Autodesk Inc.Voluntary attrition rates are down 7% year to date, compared to the same period a year prior, according to internal data Autodesk shared with CNN. Additionally, Autodesk job postings received 400% more views after Flex Forward was announced. In particular, they’re seeing a surge in female applicants and candidates who identify as people of color.A struggle not to be seen as “that remote company”At the end of the day, “we want people to want to work for Autodesk because of what we do and because of our culture,” said Pearce.But, increasingly, the talent acquisition team is seeing more candidates apply for openings because they view Autodesk as “that remote company,” Pearce added.“There’s absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to work for an organization that provides for that kind of hybrid working,” she told CNN. “But we wouldn’t want that to be the only part of our employee value proposition.”That does mean hiring managers have to be more discerning in selecting quality candidates. But, Pearce said, it’s “a nice problem to have.”For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com', 'ADSKeditorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)October 21, 2023 at 5:00 AM·6 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowADSKWatchlistKey InsightsThe projected fair value for Autodesk is US$273 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityAutodesk is estimated to be 26% undervalued based on current share price of US$203Our fair value estimate is 16% higher than Autodesk\'s analyst price target of US$236Does the October share price for Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) reflect what it\'s really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock\'s intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today\'s value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they\'re fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company\'s value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Autodesk The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company\'s cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.22bUS$1.67bUS$2.13bUS$2.42bUS$2.83bUS$3.14bUS$3.40bUS$3.62bUS$3.81bUS$3.97bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x12Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 10.91%Est @ 8.28%Est @ 6.44%Est @ 5.15%Est @ 4.25% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$1.1kUS$1.5kUS$1.7kUS$1.8kUS$2.0kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today\'s value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.0b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.2%) = US$80bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$80b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$40bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$58b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$203, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.The AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don\'t have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company\'s future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company\'s potential performance. Given that we are looking at Autodesk as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we\'ve used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.011. Beta is a measure of a stock\'s volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for AutodeskStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for ADSK.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?""

But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) share price is 58% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 5.5% in the last year.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Autodesk In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the last half decade, Autodesk became profitable. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price. Given that the company made a profit three years ago, but not five years ago, it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years, too. In fact, the Autodesk stock price is 18% lower in the last three years. During the same period, EPS grew by 35% each year. It would appear there's a real mismatch between the increasing EPS and the share price, which has declined -6% a year for three years.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Autodesk has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at Autodesk's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.A Different PerspectiveAutodesk provided a TSR of 5.5% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 10% over five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term.

If you want to skip our overview of the SaaS industry, then take a look at the 5 Best SaaS Stocks To Buy Now. The dot com era of the 1990s\xa0 focused on the consumer side of the internet, but in the background, a quiet corporate revolution was also taking place. For that time, most people can only recall the growth in internet use and bulky personal computers most likely made by International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) that could support CD disks, and flash drives, and came with a variety of accessories such as added speakers. However, the world was also seeing companies starting to rely on computers for their production, manufacturing, and supply chain planning as part of a broader group of corporate planning called enterprise resource planning (ERP).Since then, not only have the computer and the internet made unbelievable advances, but the progress of the two has created a new industry. This industry is called software as a service (SaaS) and it includes software based products that can be accessed from anywhere on the planet given that one has a stable internet connection. These products enable users, whether corporate or consumer, to use a firm's hardware infrastructure and simply pay a subscription for the usage. This comes with a variety of advantages, which include cost savings from avoiding buying bulky servers, hardware agnosticism for most of the parts except for basic specifications required for the user, and data security since all data is held on external servers.If you're having trouble understanding SaaS, then perhaps an example will help. The world's most popular digital streaming service Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) can also be classified as a SaaS. This is because all Netflix offers to its customers is a software product that can be accessed either through a computer or a smartphone. This simple software subscription enables access to television shows, movies, and documentaries - all of which are hosted on Netflix's own servers. So, the consumers are saved from having to download and save TV shows on their own devices, and for most of the part, they can also access Netflix's content from different locations without the need to carry their own computer or smartphone with them. Another popular example of a SaaS product is the online courses offered by firms such asStory continuesOn the corporate side of things, SaaS is equally as diverse. A large number of business functions now rely on third party software which saves the operating from having to invest in its own products and allows them to leverage the expertise of others that are providing customized services in the area. Some business functions that utilize SaaS are payroll processing, human resource management, supply chain management, data analysis, and accounting. Each of these has specialized tasks that can be met by software, and in the case of the SaaS services provider, the software is often regularly updated over time to account for changes from user feedback and glitches. Some examples of corporate SaaS providers include PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC), which provides product design software, Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) which provides data analysis products, and HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS), which enables customer relationship management.As to the latest trends in the SaaS industry, like nearly every other industry, it is also focusing on leveraging artificial intelligence to offer new services. For instance, HubSpot announced a new AI assistant in April 2023 to allow sales and marketing teams to create content. Additionally, one of the biggest SaaS security companies, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), is also integrating AI into its Falcon platform, with management explaining during the firm's second quarter of fiscal 2024 earnings call:Falcon is a platform that brings the benefits of generative AI to life for every SOC, CISO, CXO and enterprise. We do it with proprietary threat data, and we do it with industry-leading AI expertise. Charlotte AI is the engine powering our portfolio of generative AI capabilities across the platform, utilizing CrowdStrike's high-fidelity data advantage. Charlotte AI helps Falcon users of all skill levels to do more in the platform by automating workflows, which fuels module adoption and reduces the mean time to detect and respond. The net benefit to customers from our pioneering use of AI in a single platform is faster results, better security outcomes and lower overall cost, ushering in a new era of machine speed security. We showcased Charlotte AI earlier this month at Black Hat where we're the only vendor of consequence to showcase a live, not PowerPoint, demo of generative AI in action.Public reception was fantastic, and we will release Charlotte AI pricing at Falcon.So, with AI transforming the SaaS industry, what are the best stocks to buy?

The ADP National Employment Report is an independent measure and high-frequency view of the private-sector labor market based on actual, anonymized payroll data of more than 25 million U.S. employees.The jobs report and pay insights use ADP\'s fine-grained anonymized and aggregated payroll data to provide a representative picture of the private-sector labor market. The report details the current month\'s total private employment change, and weekly job data from the previous month. Because the underlying ADP payroll databases are continuously updated, the report provides a high-frequency, near real-time measure of U.S. employment. This measure reflects the number of employees on ADP client payrolls (Payroll Employment) to provide a richer understanding of the labor market. ADP\'s pay measure uniquely captures the earnings of a cohort of almost 10 million employees over a 12-month period.""No single industry dominated hiring this month, and big post-pandemic pay increases seem to be behind us,"" said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP.

(NASDAQ:ADP) reflect what it\'s really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock\'s intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today\'s value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company\'s cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.14bUS$5.60bUS$6.24bUS$6.39bUS$6.83bUS$7.17bUS$7.46bUS$7.72bUS$7.96bUS$8.19bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.92%Est @ 4.09%Est @ 3.51%Est @ 3.10%Est @ 2.82% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$4.8kUS$4.9kUS$5.2kUS$5.0kUS$5.0kUS$4.9kUS$4.8kUS$4.6kUS$4.5kUS$4.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$48bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business\'s cash flow after the first stage.

In the same way as with the 10-year \'growth\' period, we discount future cash flows to today\'s value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.2b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.2%) = US$189bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$189b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$100bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$148b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$218, the company appears quite good value at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company\'s future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company\'s future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company\'s potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we\'ve used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.887. Beta is a measure of a stock\'s volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Automatic Data ProcessingStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Professional Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you\'d apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company\'s valuation. For example, changes in the company\'s cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Compensation and benefits and family considerations round out the top three priorities for workers in Canada.The survey indicates that Millennials and Gen X workers are notably more inclined to prioritize work-life balance (30%), while Boomers prioritize their families (26%). Gen Z, on the other hand, is less likely to prioritize compensation (13%) than the other generations.""The survey results re-affirm the need for employers to connect with workers. Face-to-face time, coaching sessions and regular check-ins – particularly with the younger workforce, can help employers build trust and be better equipped to support their teams,"" says Ed Yuen, Vice President, Strategy and HR Outsourcing at ADP Canada.External factors impacting employee sentimentSeven-in-ten (70%) workers in Canada report feeling stressed because of inflation and the economy. In fact, due to these current economic conditions affecting employees, almost a quarter (23%) of workers are considering exploring better opportunities.Despite these challenges, 39 per cent of workers believe they are in the right workplace.The role of trust and employer proactivity in the workplaceWhile workers are reporting mixed feelings, they also indicate better levels of feedback, trust and comfort with their managers than last year, with 77 per cent of employees trusting their managers, and over eight-in-ten (82%) managers also reporting having trust in employees. The survey also finds that 72 per cent of managers say they believe their employees are happy.Story continuesAt the same time, more than half (58%) of workers indicate that their workplaces take their goals and feedback seriously, revealing a 5-percentage point increase from last year (53%). Additionally, regular check-ins remain a standard practice, as four-in-ten (42%) respondents meet with their managers or management teams weekly, fostering an environment where many workers in Canada (74%) say they feel comfortable going to their manager to voice concerns.""Positive year-over-year progress in feedback, trust and comfort between managers and employees in the Canadian workplace is promising to see,"" concludes Yuen. ""However, with more than half of workers feeling negatively towards their workplace, it suggests additional opportunities for employers to reassess and develop current workplace practices including regular one-on-one check-ins, flexible schedules and open conversations regarding compensation and benefits for current and potential employees.""Survey MethodologyThis Maru Public Opinion survey conducted on behalf of ADP Canada was undertaken by the sample and data collection experts at Maru/Blue. 1,842 employed Canadian adults (including both employees and self-employed individuals) who are Maru Voice Canada\xa0panelists were surveyed from September 15th to September 19th, 2023.

(NASDAQ:ADP) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion\'s share in the company with 82% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 11% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 9.6% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Often called “market movers"", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. Hence, if weakness in Automatic Data Processing\'s share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Automatic Data Processing. Check out our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Automatic Data Processing?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it\'s included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Automatic Data Processing already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It\'s therefore worth looking at Automatic Data Processing\'s earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don\'t have a meaningful investment in Automatic Data Processing. The company\'s largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.5%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.2% and 4.4% of the stock.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company\'s shares, meaning that the company\'s shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Automatic Data ProcessingWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Automatic Data Processing, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$74m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 18% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Automatic Data Processing. While this group can\'t necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we\'ve discovered 1 warning sign for Automatic Data Processing that you should be aware of before investing here.Ultimately the future is most important.

We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria.Maria Black: Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported strong first quarter results, including 7% revenue growth and 12% adjusted EPS growth, and we made significant progress on the three strategic priorities we shared with you last quarter. Let me begin by quickly reviewing some of our financial highlights from the first quarter. We had a solid start to the year in Employer Services new business bookings with record-level volume for first quarter which was supported by a particularly strong September. Among our best performers were our small business portfolio and our compliance-oriented solutions. Overall demand in HCM has remained steady and we maintained a healthy new business pipeline at the end of the quarter across our business.Story continuesOur Employer Services retention rate once again exceeded our expectations. Although, retention declined slightly versus the prior year, including in our small business portfolio, we continued to see resilience among our clients. More importantly, our overall NPS scores reached a new all-time high, positioning us to stay near these historically high retention levels. Our Employer Services pays per control growth was 2% for the first quarter as our clients continued to add employees at a pace that is gradually slowing. And our PEO revenue growth of 3% in the quarter was relatively stable versus last quarter, reflecting solid PEO bookings performance offset by deceleration in PEO pays per control growth. Don will speak to our updated guidance in a moment, but the demand environment for PEO as well as our other outsourcing services remains healthy.Moving on, we made meaningful progress across all three of our strategic priorities that we outlined last quarter. Let me start with an update on some actions we took in Q1 to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. First, we began embedding Gen AI features into our products. In Q1, we integrated Gen AI into Roll to further enhance its conversational UI and make it even easier for small business owners to quickly obtain customized Payroll and HR guidance. We also began rolling out ADP Assist, which delivers insights and recommendations to make complex HR work simple. We've enabled ADP Assist for select Workforce Now clients, beginning with a Report Assist feature that allows practitioners to easily extract the insights they're looking for. We look forward to continuing to build on the live feature set of ADP Assist to further enhance the experiences of both HR practitioners and employees.We also had some exciting product developments beyond AI. Our clients tell us they need personalized experiences and deep integrations to help them manage the complexity of running a business today. To help address this, we recently launched a new product called API Central, which enables businesses to easily and securely connect their ADP workforce data across systems using pre-populated APIs and tools. This is a feature our clients have increasingly asked for and we have already seen a strong uptake. In Q1, we complemented the launch of API Central with the acquisition of Sora, an intelligent workflow automation and data integration tool. Sora's unique capabilities will allow our clients to automate people processes by unifying various applications such as HR, IT, CRM, and more, creating a smarter and easier-to-use experience for our clients.In Q1, we also launched ADP Workforce Now for construction, a comprehensive offering designed to help clients with the unique payroll and HCM needs of the construction industry. This verticalized offering combines tailored Workforce Now capabilities and reporting with a team of dedicated specialists for the construction industry. While ADP has always served clients across the full spectrum of industries, construction stood out to us as a vertical with enough complexity to warrant a more tailored solution, and we're excited to further strengthen our offering in the mid-market. We also announced the launch of our corporate venture capital fund earlier this month, leading with best-in-class HCM technology requires that we stay attuned to the frontier of HCM innovation.And now, in addition to the organic efforts we are developing in ADP Ventures, we will invest in and partner with early-stage startups to strengthen our core business our core business and to extend into natural adjacencies. Two of our early investments focus on improving lifestyle benefits to drive associate engagement in simplifying the incredibly complex leave management process that businesses and their workers have to address. We're excited to build on these partnerships and develop new ones. Overall, Q1 was a very busy quarter on the product front with much of the work we're doing representing seeds of innovation that will position us to continue shaping the future of work. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing solutions.In addition to launching the pilot of ADP Assist for our clients, we also launched the pilot of our new Agent Assist embedding Gen AI in the flow of work for ADP Associates. So far, we have enabled our call summarization capability to select associates. Thanks to this Agent Assist feature, those service associates no longer need to spend time writing up case notes after client calls, which should make our associates more effective and also allow us to quickly aggregate real-time client feedback to continuously improve our products. We are also piloting Agent Assist real-time guidance for our associates to help them with support content and guided workflows and to more easily share their accumulated knowledge in a way that's customized to individual client cases.We are excited to continue working toward additional Agent Assist features to help our implementation and service associates deliver better, faster service and to help our client satisfaction scores continue to reach new record levels. Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients through our global scale, and in Q1, we expanded on this advantage. In August, we extended our leading global footprint by acquiring the payroll business of BTR, our longtime partner in Sweden. Acquisitions like this strengthen our multi-country payroll ecosystem while also positioning us to grow a local HCM business in countries with attractive growth prospects. In Q1, we launched Roll in Ireland, representing the beginning of an expansion into the European market, where we believe an AI-based payroll app coupled with our existing on the ground ecosystem will allow us to expand our SMB business outside the U.S. And during Q1, we also announced plans to deepen our existing partnership with Workday to deliver enhanced global payroll compliance and HR for the many clients we jointly serve around the world.Partnerships like this reflect our long-standing commitment to provide the personalization and overall experience our clients desire. Before turning it over to Don, I wanted to highlight a couple milestones in two of our businesses. Our suite of workforce management solutions, sometimes referred to as time and labor management, reached more than 125,000 clients in the first quarter, benefiting from a double-digit growth rate these last few years. Scheduling and precisely tracking time has become more important for employers over recent years in order to meet evolving legislative requirements, and we look forward to continuing to invest in our workforce management solutions to drive higher client attach rates. We also now serve more than 150,000 retirement services clients, which is up more than 20% from the 125,000 clients we served at the end of fiscal 2022.We anticipate growth for our retirement services business will remain strong in the years ahead as the provisions of the SECURE Act 2.0 and additional state mandates continue to phase in and as companies of all sizes continue to recognize the importance of positioning their workers well for their eventual retirement. I'm proud of our start to fiscal 2024 with both strong financial results and meaningful strategic progress. Our roadmap for the months ahead is keeping us incredibly busy. And with this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our associates across sales, service, implementation and technology whose efforts and outstanding performance are positioning us to consistently deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Thank you, all.With that, I'll turn it over to Don.Don McGuire: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some more color on our results for the quarter and update you on our fiscal '24 outlook. Overall, we had a solid Q1 and are not making changes to our consolidated outlook, but there are some moving pieces I'll cover. Let me start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 9% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis, ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, ES new business bookings had a solid start with especially strong growth in September. The demand environment is stable, our pipelines are healthy, and we are on track for our 4% to 7% growth guidance. Our ES retention did decline slightly in Q1 versus the prior year, but that was slightly better than we expected.At this point, we are maintaining our outlook for a 50 basis point to 70 basis point decline in full year retention, which continues to embed an expectation for small business losses to increase due to higher out of business rates. But if recent trends continue, then we would hope to outperform that range. ES pays per control growth was in line with our expectation in Q1. It decelerated modestly to 2%, and we expect this very gradual deceleration to continue in the coming quarters and are maintaining our outlook for 1% to 2% growth for the full year. Client funds interest revenue increased in line with our expectation in Q1, but we're raising our full year outlook based on the latest forward yield curve, which result in a modest increase in average yield to 2.9% from our prior expectation of 2.8%.We now expect client funds interest revenue as well as the net impact from our client funds extended strategy to be up $35 million from our prior outlook. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar strengthened, representing a drag relative to our prior fiscal '24 revenue outlook. In total, our strong Q1 ES revenue growth combined with higher than expected client's funds revenue for the rest of the year effectively offset the adverse FX movement and we're maintaining our fiscal '24 ES revenue growth range of 7% to 8%. Our ES margin increased 220 basis points in Q1, driven by both operating leverage and contribution from client's funds interest revenue. For the full year, we are raising our fiscal '24 outlook to now anticipate an increase of 150 basis points to 170 basis points, which reflects the benefit of higher yields, partially offset by higher spend on Gen AI projects and usage, as well as a small amount of dilution from our recent acquisitions.Moving on to the PEO. We had 3% revenue growth driven by 2% growth in average worksite employees in Q1. As Maria mentioned earlier, our PEO bookings growth was solid, but pays for control growth continued to slow and was lower than expected, particularly for clients in the professional services and tech industries. This resulted in a slightly softer Q1 worksite employee count than we were anticipating. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2024 PEO revenue growth of 3% to 4% with growth in average worksite employees of 2% to 3%. Our PEO sales pipelines are healthy and we continue to forecast their worksite employee growth gradually ramping in the back half of fiscal '24. PEO margin decreased 90 basis points in Q1 which is more than we had planned.The decline was primarily driven by a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit as well as higher selling expenses. We now expect PEO margin to be down between 50 basis points and 100 basis points in fiscal '24 with the continued assumption for higher selling expenses as well as year-over-year headwind from a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit than we experienced in fiscal '23. Putting it all together, there is no change to our consolidated outlook, but I would like to share some color on cadence. In Q2, our client funds balanced growth will lightly impact the payroll tax deferral that we had in our average balance for the past two years, which creates some grow over pressure on our client's funds balance and will result in more modest ES margin expansion in Q2 than other quarters this year as well as a modest revenue impact.As a result, we expect consolidated revenue growth to moderate before accelerating slightly in the back half. And we expect adjusted EBIT margin to be down slightly before ramping in the back half of the year. This was already contemplated in our guidance at the outset of the year. So again, no change to our consolidated guidance. We continue to forecast fiscal '24 consolidated revenue growth of 6% to 7% with our adjusted EBIT margin expanding by 60 basis points to 80 basis points. We still expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '24 to be around 23% and we anticipate adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%. Thank you.

This morning, we reported strong first quarter results, including 7% revenue growth and 12% adjusted EPS growth. And we made significant progress on the 3 strategic priorities we shared with you last quarter. Let me begin by quickly reviewing some of our financial highlights from the first quarter. We had a solid start to the year in Employer Services and new business bookings with record-level volume for a first quarter, which was supported by a particularly strong September. Among our best performers were our small business portfolio and our compliance-oriented solutions. Overall demand in HCM has remained steady, and we maintained a healthy new business pipeline at the end of the quarter across our business. Our Employer Services retention rate once again exceeded our expectations. Although retention declined slightly versus the prior year, including in our small business portfolio, we continued to see resilience among our clients. More importantly, our overall NPS scores reached a new all-time high, positioning us to stay near these historically high retention levels. Our Employer Services pays per control growth was 2% for the first quarter as our clients continue to add employees at a pace that is gradually slowing. And our PEO revenue growth of 3% in the quarter was relatively stable versus last quarter, reflecting solid PEO bookings performance, offset by deceleration in PEO pays per control growth. Don will speak to our updated guidance in a moment, but the demand environment for PEO as well as our other outsourcing services remained healthy. Moving on, we made meaningful progress across all 3 of our strategic priorities that we outlined last quarter. Let me start with an update on some actions we took in Q1 to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. First, we began embedding Gen AI features into our products. In Q1, we integrated Gen AI into Roll to further enhance its conversational UI and make it even easier for small-business owners to quickly obtain customized payroll and HR guidance. We also began rolling out ADP Assist, which delivers insights and recommendations to make complex HR work simple. We've enabled ADP Assist for select Workforce Now clients, beginning with the report of this feature that allows practitioners to easily extract the insights they're looking for.

Sora's unique capabilities will allow our clients to automate people processes by unifying various applications such as HR, IT, CRM and more, creating a smarter and easier-to-use experience for our clients. In Q1, we also launched ADP Workforce Now for Construction, a comprehensive offering designed to help clients with the unique payroll and HCM needs of the construction industry. This verticalized offering combines tailored Workforce Now capabilities and reporting with a team of dedicated specialists for the construction industry. While ADP has always served clients across the full spectrum of industries, construction stood up test as a vertical with enough complexity to warrant a more tailored solution. And we're excited to further strengthen our offering in the mid-market. We also announced the launch of our corporate venture capital fund earlier this month. Leading with best-in-class HCM technology requires that we stay attuned to the frontier of HCM innovation. And now in addition to the organic efforts we are developing in ADP Ventures, we will invest in and partner with early-stage start-ups to strengthen our core business and to extend into natural adjacencies. Two of our early investments focus on improving lifestyle benefits to drive associate engagement and simplifying the incredibly complex lead management process that businesses and their workers have to address. We're excited to build on these partnerships and develop new ones. Overall, Q1 was a very busy quarter on the product front, with much of the work we're doing representing seeds of innovation that will position us to continue shaping the future of work. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise in outsourcing solutions. In addition to launching the pilot of ADP Assist for our clients, we also launched the pilot of our new Agent Assist, embedding Gen AI and the flow of work for ADP associates. So far, we have enabled our call summarization capability to select associates. Thanks to this Agent Assist feature, those service associates no longer need to spend time writing up case notes after client calls, which should make our associates more effective and also allow us to quickly aggregate real-time client feedback to continuously improve our products. We are also piloting Agent Assist real-time guidance for our associates to help them with support content and guided workflows and to more easily share their accumulated knowledge in a way that's customized to individual client cases. We are excited to continue working toward additional Agent Assist features to help our implementation and service associates deliver better, faster service and to help our client satisfaction scores continue to reach new record levels. Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients through our global scale. And in Q1, we expanded on this advantage. In August, we extended our leading global footprint by acquiring the payroll business of BTR, our long-time partner in Sweden. Acquisitions like this strengthen our multi-country payroll ecosystem while also positioning us to grow a local HCM business in countries with attractive growth prospects. In Q1, we launched Roll in Ireland, representing the beginning of an expansion into the European market where we believe an AI-based payroll app, coupled with our existing on-the-ground ecosystem, will allow us to expand our SMB business outside the U.S. And during Q1, we also announced plans to deepen our existing partnership with Workday to deliver enhanced global payroll, compliance and HR for the many clients we jointly serve around the world. Partnerships like this reflect our long-standing commitment to provide the personalization and overall experience our clients desire. Before turning it over to Don, I wanted to highlight a couple of milestones in 2 of our businesses. Our suite of workforce management solutions, sometimes referred to as time and labor management, reached more than 125,000 clients in the first quarter, benefiting from a double-digit growth rate these last few years. Scheduling and precisely tracking time has become more important for employers over recent years in order to meet evolving legislative requirements, and we look forward to continuing to invest in our workforce management solutions to drive higher client attach rates. We also now serve more than 150,000 retirement services clients, which is up more than 20% from 125,000 clients we served at the end of fiscal 2022. We anticipate growth for our retirement services business will remain strong in the years ahead as the provisions of the SECURE Act 2.0 and additional state mandates continue to phase in and as companies of all sizes continue to recognize the importance of positioning their workers well for their eventual retirement. I'm proud of our start to fiscal 2024 with both strong financial results and meaningful strategic progress. Our road map for the months ahead is keeping us incredibly busy. And with this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our associates across sales, service, implementation and technology whose efforts and outstanding performance are positioning us to consistently deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Thank you all. With that, I'll turn it over to Don.Don Edward McGuireThank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some more color on our results for the quarter and update you on our fiscal '24 outlook. Overall, we had a solid Q1 and are not making changes to our consolidated outlook, but there are some moving pieces I'll cover. Let me start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 9% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis, ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, ES new business bookings had a solid start with especially strong growth in September. The demand environment is stable, our pipelines are healthy and we are on track for our 4% to 7% growth guidance. Our ES retention did decline slightly in Q1 versus the prior year, but that was slightly better than we expected. At this point, we are maintaining our outlook for a 50 to 70 basis point decline in full year retention, which continues to embed an expectation for small business losses to increase due to higher out-of-business rates. But if recent trends continue, then we would hope to outperform that range. ES pays per control growth was in line with our expectation in Q1. It decelerated modestly to 2%, and we expect this very gradual deceleration to continue in the coming quarters and are maintaining our outlook for 1% to 2% growth for the full year. Client funds interest revenue increased in line with our expectation in Q1, but we're raising our full year outlook based on the latest forward yield curve, which resulted in a modest increase in average yield to 2.9% from our prior expectation of 2.8%. We now expect client funds interest revenue as well as the net impact from our client funds extended strategy to be up $35 million from our prior outlook. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar strengthened, representing a drag relative to our prior fiscal '24 revenue outlook. In total, our strong Q1 ES revenue growth, combined with higher-than-expected client funds revenue for the rest of the year, effectively offset the adverse FX movement. And we're maintaining our fiscal '24 ES revenue growth range of 7% to 8%. Our ES margin increased 220 basis points in Q1, driven by both operating leverage and contribution from client funds interest revenue. For the full year, we are raising our fiscal '24 outlook to now anticipate an increase of 150 to 170 basis points, which reflects the benefit of higher yields, partially offset by higher spend on Gen AI projects and usage as well as a small amount of dilution from our recent acquisitions. Moving on to the PEO, we had 3% revenue growth, driven by 2% growth in average worksite employees in Q1. As Maria mentioned earlier, our PEO bookings growth was solid, but pays per control growth continued to slow and was lower than expected, particularly for clients in the professional services and tech industries. This resulted in a slightly softer Q1 worksite employee count than we were anticipating. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2024 PEO revenue growth of 3% to 4% with growth in average worksite employees of 2% to 3%. Our PEO sales pipelines are healthy, and we continue to forecast their worksite employee growth gradually ramping in the back half of fiscal '24. PEO margin decreased 90 basis points in Q1, which is more than we had planned. The decline was primarily driven by a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit as well as higher selling expenses. We now expect PEO margin to be down between 50 and 100 basis points in fiscal '24, with a continued assumption for higher selling expenses as well as year-over-year headwind from a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit that we experienced in fiscal '23. Putting it all together, there is no change to our consolidated outlook, but I would like to share some color on cadence. In Q2, our client funds balance growth will lack the impact of the payroll tax deferral that we've had in our average balance for the past 2 years, which creates some [grow-over] pressure on our client funds balance and will result in more modest ES margin expansion in Q2 than other quarters this year as well as a modest revenue impact. As a result, we expect consolidated revenue growth to moderate before accelerating slightly in the back half. And we expect adjusted EBIT margin to be down slightly before ramping in the back half of the year. This was already contemplated in our guidance at the outset of the year. So again, no change to our consolidated guidance. We continue to forecast fiscal '24 consolidated revenue growth of 6% to 7% with our adjusted EBIT margin expanding by 60 to 80 basis points. We still expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '24 to be around 23%, and we anticipate adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies.Samad Saleem SamanaMaybe first, just want to double click on the PEO side. I think that the information you gave helps us understand some of what happened in the revised guidance. But maybe just help us understand what's giving that back half ramp confidence, especially as you expect pays per control in the kind of broader macro to continue to decelerate. Where should we get the acceleration in the PEO WSEs? Is it purely based on bookings ramping? Is it based on an expectation that the base will stabilize? Maybe just dig into that a little bit further because they're moving in different directions.Maria BlackYou bet. Samad, it's Maria here. I thought I'd kind of break down your question with respect to the PEO, call it double click. So I'll start by commenting on the first quarter. So as mentioned, we did see deceleration in PEO pays per control. So as Don mentioned in the opening comments, that is a by-product of what we're seeing in the pressure with respect to -- as you know, that business tends to skew more into professional services, technology. The pays per control deceleration is happening at a faster clip in those cohorts than the broader base. And so said differently, the pays per control growth in the PEO is decelerating faster than we expected and faster specifically in those cohorts. So in terms of contribution, that is the contribution to the deceleration or the new guide to worksite employee growth that we're seeing in the first quarter. We did have strong bookings in PEO in the first quarter. That said, it did come in slightly below what we had hoped for. So it was still higher than overall Employer Services. It was a good quarter for the PEO, and this is now the third quarter in a row that we've seen strength in bookings in the PEO. And that's important to note because really, the strength in PEO bookings is what ultimately will yield the reacceleration that you're asking about in the back half; that, coupled with kind of what we're seeing in retention. So while retention is stable and stabilizing inside the PEO, it isn't back to the high growth levels that we saw, call it, a couple of years ago, in the last year or so. And as such, as those compares continue to lap, coupled with retention continuing to accelerate, if you will, versus stabilize, we will see contributions from retention, we'll see more contributions from bookings, and that's really why we anticipate the worksite employee guide for the year that we've given.Samad Saleem SamanaGreat. And then, Maria, I actually had a follow-up for you as well on the international side. We have seen the rollout of the product into Ireland. And I'm just curious, how should we think about the expansion beyond the U.S.? I know ADP already has a presence, and it's a meaningful contributor to revenue, but just should we think about international maybe being an offset to some of the slowdown that we're seeing in U.S. revenue? Just how should we think about the cadence and impact as you move more international with your core HCM solutions versus just helping U.S. employers that already had an international presence?Maria BlackYes, absolutely. So I'll speak to Roll, which is what I commented on in the opening comments. So we did roll out, no pun intended, our Roll offering into Ireland. And it is an exciting bit for us, albeit it's very, very early days, right? It's actually only been a couple of weeks, but we're excited about it because it's the first of many countries where we intend on taking this, call it, very downmarket offering into our various countries throughout international. And it's really about marrying that product. But what we see is still potentially greenfield opportunity within our international space and really leveraging the ecosystem that we have. That's everything from distribution to all the services, call it, around the offers in various countries. So we're very excited about that. Now in terms of the overall growth contributions in the short term of rolling out Roll into Ireland, I would say they're negligible. I would say even Roll over time this year, I think it would be not a meaningful contributor to bookings. To me, I think this is really about a long-term investment that we're making across international and what we see as a continued opportunity for us. So you kind of mentioned these companies that have a presence in Europe that exist in the U.S. with folks working in or call it in international. And the answer is this is both that, coupled also with a lot of our, what I would say, best-of-breed offerings in international. So we see growth opportunity really across the board in international, and that's everything from the down market, which we're going after now with this new product offering of Roll. So we see it in the SMB space, we see it in our best-of-breed space and we also see it in our global MNC space. So really excited about the long-term growth opportunity that continues to be international. And while I'm on international, I thought I would just mention because it's important to note, we did have a very strong quarter with respect to international, albeit that quarter is obviously off of a compare Q1 of last year that was less favorable, but it is on the heels of what was a very strong fourth quarter finish in international. And so all the way around, I continue to be incredibly excited and optimistic about what it is that we can go accomplish and continue to build in our international offering.OperatorOur next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.Bryan C. BerginSo Maria, I was hoping if you can comment on just how you're seeing the overall macro situation evolve and maybe how that may affect demand. And if you can specifically unpack that within the ES segment, maybe talk about some of the areas that came in better than you expected versus any areas that may have been lighter or downtick versus the prior quarter.Maria BlackAbsolutely. Bryan, so happy to comment on what we saw in the first quarter with respect to the overall performance of bookings but also the demand. So I'll kind of start with the overall performance. I mentioned in the opening comments, we did see strength, continued strength in our down market. So really excited about that. Also saw tremendous strength in our compliance solutions offering. So think of it as all the stuff that hits compliance, tax, things of that nature. So we're pleased with what we saw with respect to our new business bookings. Those are the 2 that really outperformed. And it's exciting to see because really that entire down market offering, and that's everything from our RUN offering to retirement services, insurance services, we continue to see tremendous strength there. We saw that all of last year and definitely the -- to finish last year, and it makes me happy because it's a lot of the places that -- well, good performance makes me happy regardless. But it's a lot of the places where we've been making meaningful investments both in the product as well as the distribution. So excited to see the continued performance there and the outperformance. The overall results do keep us in line with our full year guide. So excited to confirm that again here today. In terms of the overall demand environment, and I feel like I've been saying this quarter-to-quarter, but we're not really seeing any major changes in demand. Demand is still -- strong demand is still healthy. We see that in our bookings results. There are all sorts of other indicators that we look at in terms of pipelines in the upmarket, in the mid-market. Certainly, in the down market, we're looking at things such as the new appointments and kind of activity measures to really give us a guide on whether demand is strong. And I would tell you, pipelines are healthy year-on-year, and certainly activity is healthy. And so we don't see a big demand change again this quarter. In fact, kind of the opposite stepping into the quarter on the heels of a strong September, we feel really good about where our pipelines sit year-on-year, which again is giving us the confidence in the full year guide. As always, though, Bryan, we continue to keep an eye on the macro. We continue to keep an eye on our global space and international and making sure that we're understanding both any macroeconomic changes, coupled with any demand environment that could shift, given everything kind of going on in the world, if you will. So that's the current story on kind of pipeline demand in the quarter.Don Edward McGuireYes. If I could add a couple of comments on the macro. Certainly, macro continues to be pretty positive. Unemployment rates continue to be near decade lows here in the United States. Unemployment rates around the world continue to be quite low. The discussion about whether or not we're going to be in a recession, the odds are now not for a recession. So soft land is pretty much what is being anticipated. Interest rates are expected to have peaked here in the U.S. So I think all things considered, things are pretty positive. I think the one area that we put in, in our original guidance for the year and that we continue to look at is our guidance had, in fact, contemplated the slowing in pays per control growth. Maria mentioned that, and we talked about that in the PEO business. But we are confident we are still seeing growth, albeit we are seeing growth at a slower pace than we had previously. But once again, that was fully contemplated in our original guide for the year.Bryan C. BerginOkay, that's helpful. My follow-up on the PEO. So I heard that bookings are a little bit lighter than you expected to start. But you're also calling out, I think, higher selling expenses impacting the PEO margins here year-over-year. So can you maybe talk about the puts and takes there driving that dynamic?Maria BlackSpecifically on PEO margins, I'll let Don...Don Edward McGuireWell, I think originally, Bryan, you mentioned that bookings were lighter than expected. I think our bookings came in -- bookings had been pretty good, as Maria has mentioned...Maria BlackYes, I think he's referencing the comment I made around PEO bookings was slightly lighter than expected. By the way, it's still higher than ES, which we expect to be the case throughout the balance of the year. So that's the kind of nuanced...Bryan C. BerginSo I guess the sort of question there, are you also citing higher selling expenses impacting the PEO margins? So it seems like there's a bit of a disconnect there. Just trying to understand that.Don Edward McGuireYes. So we had planned the year. We talked about the growth being stronger in the second half in bookings -- or sorry, in margins than in the first half. And certainly, we have seen some investments and some higher selling expenses, and we'll see in the first half than we will in the second half. But nothing really surprising, a little bit off, but certainly we're in line with what we expected.OperatorOur next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.James Eugene FaucetteI wanted to ask just a couple of quick follow-up questions. First, I think the comment was made that you're still anticipating a bit worse performance in terms of out-of-business rates on a go-forward basis. But to date, those have been a little bit better than you had anticipated. Can you help provide some detail as to what you're seeing, why you think we're seeing better survival rates and kind of the things you may be looking at as indicators that, that could get worse on a go-forward basis?Don Edward McGuireYes, demand continues to be strong in the economy overall. And I think that's supporting what tends to be this view that we're not going to enter into a recession, that that's just going to be a soft landing. So I think that strong demand environment, particularly in consumer demand, is keeping small business afloat. So when you also look at what we're seeing in terms of new business formations, there seems to be continued strength in new business formations. So generally, I would say that the environment, irrespective of the higher interest rates, the environment continues to be favorable for small business, and I think that's translating itself into what looks to be lower out of business than contemplated. Now we have continued, as we said in our original guide and as we will reiterate or update here today, we have continued to think that we will see a little bit more normalization in other business. So we have contemplated that, but we think we are getting closer to where we think we're going to plateau or hit the bottom there. So I think we're very close. And once again, I think it just comes back to demand environment, it tends to be supporting the economy more broadly and more generally and small businesses benefiting from that as well.Maria BlackYes, I think if I may, I think the only thing I would add is that it's still very early in the year, right? So when I think about retention, we did have a record level in fiscal '23. We were near that record level a year before. We were at that record level the year before that. And so we've had this tremendous strength, and I think Don is spot on in terms of all the reasons from a macro perspective that we've had that strength in terms of client retention. And so as that normalizes, we believe it's still prudent for us to have the retention guide that we have, which is really a by-product of how we planned the year in the back half. So I think I got the question last quarter, and so I'll answer it proactively this quarter, which is, are we just being conservative? And I think the answer to that question is it's still early in the year. And so if we do continue to outperform retention in the way that we outperformed in the first quarter, we hope that we will outperform for the full year. It's just early to take away that conservatism sitting here just 3 short months into a very long year.James Eugene FaucetteYes, yes. And then I want to go back to kind of a headline-related question. You saw that you saw -- or you indicated that you had seen kind of a 25,000 sequential improvement in retirement services. And for clients, you alluded to some state mandates there, particularly around SECURE Act 2.0. Can you talk a little bit about what state mandates you've seen or may be impacting that business? Or how long before we start to see benefit in retirement services post the new state mandates? So maybe we can help track headlines and anticipate like how big of an impact any new requirements may have.Maria BlackAbsolutely. So I think I've spoken quite a bit to retirement services as well as the SECURE Act over the last year or so. And I will tell you, I was excited to report the new milestone today, in part because that business continues to show strength, but also because it's a business that I know is adding tremendous value into the world of work. And so it is an exciting time. It does come as a by-product of the offering, the investments we've made into the offering and also the state mandates, some of which are anchored into the SECURE Act at the federal level, some of which are anchored state by state. Candidly, I could probably spend an hour with you and go state by state in terms of all the various mandates. What we see over the next year or so is the threshold of companies that needs to comply with the state mandates, starts to creep into, call it, the further down market, if not the micro market. And so as all these states, a lot of them being on the West Coast, if you're looking for headlines, tracking spaces like California, as they continue to pull down at what level do you need to comply with the state mandates and/or the SECURE Act, the more opportunity we will have to ensure that we're helping our clients solve for this piece, keep them compliant. But again, back to doing good in the world, it's also something that's bringing the value to each one of these employees that are engaging with these clients. So...OperatorOur next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.Bryan Connell KeaneJust want to ask about the decline in PEO. Looking at the employee base of PEO declining versus not necessarily the case, it looks like almost the opposite in the Employer Services. So just trying to think about the trends. And does typically the trend you see in PEO bleed into Employer Services and why maybe it's been a little bit weaker for pays per control there in PEO versus Employer?Maria BlackYes. So just to clarify, pays per control in PEO is actually higher. We don't give that number, but it's actually higher than Employer Services. So I think the first piece to suggest is that the bases are actually just different, right? So if you look at the pays per control across the broader ADP, it's really a reflection of a mix of industries. As I mentioned earlier, the PEO tends to skew by design, by the way, for the offering. It's really the offering is the most valuable, if you will, to the cohorts that we offer to, which tends to be more professional services, tech-oriented companies that want to offer employers or their employees benefits of choice, if you will, to the employers of choice. And so that skews that base slightly differently than the overall. And what we're seeing within the PEO base is a delineation between those cohorts and the rest of the base, if you will. So we cited it in the prepared remarks, but the deceleration that is happening at the PEO is still a by-product within that base, having professional services and tech decelerating at a faster clip than the rest of the base. So to answer your question, does it bleed across? I think we're already hearing these headlines in the market in terms of -- and we see it within our own ADP Research Institute data with respect to professional services and tech hiring being in a different position than the rest of the market. So I think I would suggest it's already been bleeding across, if you look at the last couple of quarters of that. By the way, that also tracks the BLS data, shows the same thing. You see it in wages. And so all of that to suggest, I would say, the trend we're seeing in the PEO is already in the macro, but the bases are slightly different, which is why you would feel the impact of it perhaps more significantly in the PEO PPC than you would in the broader PPC. That was a mouthful, by the way.Bryan Connell KeaneNo, that was helpful though. And then the other question I just had is the strength you saw in the ES new bookings, especially in September and the way the pipeline looks, but you're not changing the total outlook of 4% to 7%. Just trying to figure out, do you feel like you guys are maybe trending if things hold, trending above the guidance range for bookings given the strength you saw in September in the pipeline and for SMB strength in the quarter?Maria BlackYes. What I would offer is that I'm incredibly pleased with the results in the first quarter, especially on the heels of what was an incredible finish last year. And so the pattern that we saw in the first quarter and the strength in September is not atypical of the pattern we see in the first quarter on the heels of an incredibly strong fourth quarter. And so I am excited about the first quarter results. I am excited about the strength in September. But the excitement is actually less about, call it, the finish in September and more about what we see on the year-on-year demand environment, what we see in activity, what we see stepping into this next quarter. And that does give us confidence into our full year guide at that 4% to 7%. What I would also offer, though, is it's a long year. And when you think about where the skewing, if you will, or the contribution of new business bookings happens for us on a full year basis, it is in that third and fourth quarter are much, call it, larger than the first and second quarter. And so we believe it's prudent given the line of sight that we have today just at quarter end. But we feel confident in the guide. We're excited about performance. We're excited about how we're stepping into the quarter, the second quarter that is, but we also still have an entire year ahead of us.OperatorOur next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.Ramsey Clark El-AssalCould you give us your latest thoughts on the competitive environment in PEO and how that's sort of evolving over time? I think there is somewhat slower-than-historical growth across the industry. Are there any signs that the market is saturated with providers? Or is there any competitive overlay to PEO performance?Maria BlackI would suggest that the PEO/ASO conversation, if you will, or PEO/HR outsourcing offerings kind of continues. I don't know that there's anything new to report, Ramsey. I think from my vantage point, it's always been a very competitive environment. We all have slightly different PEOs from one another. I think we talked a lot about ours today and the way that it skews to professional services and tech. I think you have others that's skewed to different types of industries. You also have other PEOs that perhaps are a bit more down market. We tend to skew a little bit more up market than some. And so I think all the PEOs look slightly different. I think we all know our models are also not identical in terms of how we actually go to market, whether it's through the strength that we have and the competitive advantage of being able to have ADP's client base contribute about 50% of those upgrades. So I think how we go to market, our models, never mind the models of fully insured to self-insured, et cetera, I think similar trends are within the ASO offerings or some refer to them as HRO offerings. And so I think within there, you also have various models and various go-to-markets in terms of the -- some competitors perhaps have some flexibility or more movements between ASO and PEO than I think we've cited in the past. And so I think all that to suggest, I think the competitive environment is about the same and remains. I think I am optimistic and expect growth in both our PEO bookings as well as our HRO and ASO offerings throughout the balance of this year. And so I think we remain very, very excited and optimistic about the growth of those, all of our HR outsourcing offerings, both in this year as well as the long term.Ramsey Clark El-AssalGot it. Okay. And a follow-up for me. Could I ask you to revisit those comments that you made about higher selling expenses in PEO? What does that mean exactly? And also just I wanted to make sure I understood, Don mentioned that there's some expectations those may continue, but there's still, in essence, sort of a nonrecurring step-up in expenses. It's not a permanent step-up in expenses in the segment.Don Edward McGuireYes, we saw higher selling expenses in Q1 for the PEO, and we expect to see higher selling expenses year-over-year in the first half, but we do think that that's going to settle down into the second half. So we're not looking at the kind of growth that we saw last year. I think we commented quite extensively on the many, many salespeople we've added into the business last year and had great success and allowed us to finish the year the way we did. So those folks are in place. So we are continuing to add some sellers. We will add, though, most of those sellers in the first half. And it's important just also, I think, call out here that what we are seeing with our sellers is that we are getting much better retention within the seller community. So we are hoping and expecting to benefit from the improved tenure that we should see from the selling organization as we go through the balance of this year.Ramsey Clark El-AssalI got it. So it's headcount-related primarily. That makes a lot of sense.Maria BlackYes, I think it's a timing thing. I think that's the...Ramsey Clark El-AssalGot it.OperatorOur next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.Jason Alan KupferbergJust staying on PEO for a second and maybe if we can just refresh a little bit here. I'm just thinking back to the Analyst Day 2 years ago, we thought it was a medium-term 10% to 12% grower. Now it's 2% to 3% at the moment. There was definitely some post-COVID normalization. But maybe just, Maria, if you want to take us back through the dynamics in terms of just how the business has evolved from your perspective. And is there a potential path back to double-digit growth for this business if the macro is a little bit more cooperative?Maria BlackYes. So I'll let Don kind of speak to the medium-term targets and kind of the path back. But I think from my vantage point, and I said it earlier today, that step 1 is the continued reacceleration of bookings. And so this is the third quarter that we're pleased, and we did have a solid contribution of PEO bookings to the overall bookings picture in this quarter. That was the case last quarter, it was the case the quarter before. And I think the reason that I go to that is not just because it's the piece that will accelerate the growth and pass us back to what our long-term goals and medium-term targets are with -- for that business, I think it's also because it speaks to the demand environment. It speaks to the value proposition and the strength of that offering that still exists in the market. And so I think that's a big piece of it. I think step 2 is the continued acceleration, reacceleration of retention. So I mentioned that retention has been stable. And as we reaccelerate retention back into that growth, that also will contribute to, obviously, the revenue. And then last but not least, Jason, you mentioned it, the macro headwinds. And I think I talked about the last couple of quarters, how that's been the post-pandemic, call it, nuances that impacted that business. I think we talked a lot about the renewal over the last couple of quarters. Now we're seeing these trends in PPC. My view would be that all of the post-pandemic wave that have been, call it, flowing through the PEO and all the variables that make up that model, we're still seeing some of those, case in point being really, call it, the reversion of what we saw several quarters ago, which was when professional services and tech was in a massive hiring boom. Now we're seeing the opposite of that, right? So I think we still have some of these waves kind of shuffling through or whether -- or going through -- flowing through the PEO. And if and when the macro changes with respect to that, that certainly will help reaccelerate that business as well. So in terms of the path back, I'll let Don kind of speak to the medium-term targets.Don Edward McGuireYes. I think Maria covered it very comprehensively there. I would say that when we established the midterm targets, I think a lot of things have changed since then, certainly the inflation environment that we've seen in particular. And Maria just mentioned professional services and technology, we saw incredible growth in those segments and growth beyond what we thought we -- or what we had predicted in the midterm targets or spoken to. I think now we're seeing some reversion. We do, though, continue to be incredibly positive about that business. We think it definitely has a place, and we think that we will make our way back. But as Maria also said, it's a little bit early to forecast when we think we're going to get back to some of those midterm target growth areas that we had discussed.Jason Alan KupferbergUnderstood. No, that's good color. Just a follow-up on float yield. It looks like it was actually a tick down slightly quarter-over-quarter here in Q1 amid a higher rate environment. But just curious what the call-outs might be there.Danyal HussainJason, that just relates to the mix between short term and extended and long. So in Q4, we were a little more levered to overnight partly because of this debt ceiling issue. We had to be deliberately skewed shorter duration. But in a typical Q1, we would generally have a lower short portfolio. And so there is seasonality in the average balance, wouldn't read much into it. The year-over-year number is a much more relevant metric.OperatorOur next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.Tien-Tsin HuangForgive me if I'm asking another clarification on the PEO side. Just the slight -- was the slight softness in the bookings also related to the PS and tech sectors? And also with the pays per control within PEO, is that more of a health care participation issue or just labor weakness in those sectors?Maria BlackI really apologize, you actually bleeped out during the first part of your question. Would you mind just repeating -- yes, there was a word missing. So...Tien-Tsin HuangNo, no, I probably didn't ask it very well. Just wanted to make sure the bookings softness on the PEO side, was that also in the professional services and tech sectors? And then also just on the pays per control, was it labor weakness or health care participation?Maria BlackYes. Listen, so I'm glad you're asking this question actually because I just want to reiterate, we were very pleased with our PEO bookings. And so there wasn't softness. There was strength and growth in the PEO quarter bookings. In terms of how we skewed the year, it was slightly lighter than we had positioned our planning, which is why it contributes the way that it does to the overall worksite employee growth. But again, the worksite employee deceleration is really about the PPC story. And so I just want to reiterate, we were actually very pleased with the quarter from a PEO bookings perspective. In terms of the industries, I think it's a mix. I think we continue to see the PEO execute with respect to the industries that we target, which tend to be into those categories. As it relates to this comment around kind of within the PEO, the deceleration that is happening faster in professional services and technology versus the broader base of the PEO, again, I don't want to give kind of the numbers of what that is, but it isn't like the entire base is sitting in professional services. It's just that subset, if you will, of the base. And it is really -- again, kind of triangulates to the macro that we're seeing and the same type of data coming out of ADP Research Institute, out of the BLS, and it's really about hiring. So it's less about, call it, layoffs. And it's really where the professional services and tech industries were doing massive hiring, call it, a year ago, 6 quarters ago. It's really a lack of hiring that's happening in those businesses. Did I answer that question?Tien-Tsin HuangYes, I think so. I think the...Danyal HussainTien-Tsin, just on the participation piece of it, the pays per control wouldn't be impacted by participation rate, but the reported revenue would be. So to the extent workers are taking plans, cheaper plans or fewer plans, there's a little bit of that. You do see it in the revenue per WSE, but the WSEs themselves wouldn't be impacted.Tien-Tsin HuangGot it. Danny, I didn't ask you. Well, that's perfect. That's what I was looking for. On the -- we get questions around pricing as well. That's why I was asking about the participation side of things and if there's a difference there. It sounds like it isn't. On the international front, just my quick follow-up. Just I think Sweden was the call-out in terms of acquisition. Why is Sweden important to own? Just I'm not as familiar with some of the specific countries that you're targeting. And I'm curious if this is just part of a -- maybe a broader plan to aggregate international payroll.Maria BlackAbsolutely. So listen, I have to take this question because I think you may know that I'm actually -- I was born and partially raised in Sweden. So I thought it was prudent to make it the very first country that I announce. I'm actually completely kidding. This was obviously well in motion before my time. But it sounds like I might be closer to Sweden than you are. And for us, it is an exciting time for us. We have had this partnership with BTR for quite some time. For us to be able to acquire the payroll business of BTR is exciting because the Nordics are growing, and this does give us a physical footprint into Sweden, which allows us to expand further into the Nordics and really take advantage of the growth trajectory of those economies. So this is obviously payroll, but also in the beyond-payroll opportunities that we will have in years to come. So really excited about the acquisition, not just because it's near and dear to my heart, but moreover because the Nordics represent growth, and it's exciting to think about us having a physical presence there.OperatorOur next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI.David Mark TogutYou called out strength in ES bookings, particularly in the small business market with RUN. Could you provide some texture into the bookings trends you saw in mid-market with Workforce Now and then up market with enterprise? And any insights you have into international bookings in the quarter would also be appreciated.Maria BlackAbsolutely. So yes, we did have great strength in the down markets, kind of moving on up in the mid-market. Certainly, we have continued solid demand in the mid-market. That's inclusive of our Workforce Now platform. It's also inclusive of our HR outsourcing offering. So I spoke a bit about the ASO models, the HRO models earlier in that mid-market, also it's supported by the PEO. So we do see continued demand from the mid-market. I think the way I always think about it, it's not getting any easier for companies in that mid-market to navigate being an employer today. And so we expect continued strong mid-market growth. I think in the up market, since you asked about the enterprise space, one of the call-outs we made last quarter was about the strength that we saw in our Next Generation HCM offering, and we did see that strength continue into this quarter, which we think is fantastic. We also see strength in the pipeline in that space year-on-year. So excited about what we're hearing from our clients, the sentiments around the offerings that we have in the enterprise space. And then I think I touched a little bit on international earlier, but our international business did grow nicely in the first quarter. Again, it was the benefit of a little bit of an easier compare year-on-year. But we also had, as I mentioned, a really strong finish and a strong fiscal '23 in our international business. Again, what I measure is partly the results. But as I think about the look forward, it's really about pipelines. And what I would say, our international pipelines year-on-year have a fair amount higher than they did a year ago, which gives us the strength to really feel good about our international bookings to remain healthy through fiscal '24.David Mark TogutJust as a quick follow-up. Don, you called out part of the 90 basis point margin decline in PEO being traced to a difficult comparison on workers' compensation reserve adjustments a year ago. Can you quantify for us how large those were as we think through the margin comparisons for Q2, Q3 and Q4 of FY '24 in PEO?Don Edward McGuireYes. So as you know, we've had very favorable reserve releases over the last number of years and certainly called out last year in the K. You would have seen the favorability there. So just to be clear, we are still seeing favorable reserve releases, but we are not seeing -- we didn't see the reserve release to the extent that we did Q1 to Q1 of the prior year. So the numbers will be in the Q, but it's about $6.2 million less than it was in the prior year. So that's the quantification of it. And if you kind of translate that into the margin, it's about 60 to 90 bps -- 60 bps of the 90 bps decline comes from the lower reserve release. Now once again, we think that we're going to continue to see reserve releases. They were favorable as the actuaries get back to us and let us know what's happening, but we're not seeing any underlying changes or large changes that would lead us to be any less optimistic about seeing continued releases in the reserve.Danyal HussainAnd David, sorry, just to clarify, it was a $6 million benefit in Q1, which is about $8 million less than the prior year.OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird.Mark Steven MarconAt HR tech, you got to see a lot of your new solutions, particularly focused on the AI-assisted solutions. Maria, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about your philosophy with regards to which solutions you would charge additional for. How are you thinking about monetization? And then I've got a follow-up in terms of process improvement.Maria BlackSure. Mark, I'm pretty excited about all of our new solutions that you would have seen at HR tech. So I think I'll take a minute to kind of think -- or talk through how I'm thinking about Gen AI in general, and then I'll tell you how I'm thinking about monetization because I think it'll make more sense on the other side. But when I think about Gen AI, I think it will impact everything. So the answer is it's going to be everywhere impacting everything that we do across the entire client life cycle. So it's about how we develop products. That's everything from developer copilot types of tools that everyone is talking about. It's about how Gen AI will be embedded into our product. It's about how we go to market and modern seller stuff that I've spoken about for years and how we actually have the ability now leveraging Gen AI to actually acquire clients. And then the most obvious being how we serve them, how we implement them, how we become more productive and make our clients more productive as we serve our clients. And so when I think about Gen AI, and I think most -- everyone has probably likened us to things like whether it's software or the Internet, I think my answer to you is it will be in everything that we do and in the fabric of who we become. And so in terms of the monetization side, I think it's less about charging a [PEPM] on a per feature. So let's say, some of the things I talked about today, which probably doesn't sound that exciting, like report writing or if you look at the earnings release document, you'll see in there a job description that's pulled in the screenshot showing roles. So these things probably don't sound that exciting, but they're pretty exciting because they are the seeds of innovation, as I used earlier, to really show what -- how Gen AI will interact with in everything that we do kind of in the fabric. So said differently, Mark, like I don't think we're going to be charging separately to get Gen AI job description written or Gen AI report written. I think it's really about continuing our innovation journey to do all the things we've always done, which is really about becoming more productive. It's about solving things for our clients and making them more productive. And I think that, to me, the fruits of that labor really end up in new business bookings and they end up in retention. And so that's not to suggest that there may not be things. But I don't think it's really to me about [$0.50 PEPM] here and there. To me, it's really about the innovation journey we've been on. This just allows us to do it at a faster clip. And I'm really optimistic and excited about the things that we're seeing. In terms of other things that we're measuring, we actually have the entire organization rallied to engage in these tools. We actually have some goals that we put out there in terms of, by the end of the year, how many of our associates that sit across sales and implementation and service and technology that are engaging with these tools. Right now, they're sitting at already above 10% of our base of associates that have the ability to touch these tools or already playing with them. I would tell you, our entire sales organization are chomping up a bit because the digital sales or inside sales where we've deployed a lot of these modern tools over years have an ability to become that much more productive, engaging our new prospects and new sales. So as you can probably tell, like I literally could go on and on and on, but I think my answer to you is it will be everywhere across the entire client life cycle that we have. And I'm very optimistic about the long-term implications of this on all the major metrics that make up this great business model.Mark Steven MarconThat's terrific. And then with regards to just the productivity enhancement, I mean, particularly when we think about service and implementation, from a longer-term perspective, can you describe how much more efficient you think your service personnel could become? And how much efficiency you could end up gaining there and the implications from continuous margin improvement as you continue to go along that journey? I know it's early days, but just how are you thinking about that?Maria BlackYes. Listen, Mark, it is early days, right? And that's not for a lack of scoping it, right? So we have had because it's not as though we haven't had all of these business cases over many years on how to become more productive, and we've had machine learning and regular AI in our house for a long time. And this does give us a step change to that innovation. But it's still too early, I think, to sit on an earnings call and commit numbers. But that's not for a lack of internally having scoping and line of sight to what we believe are pretty exciting goals for us to go chase. And again, some of those goals have existed for a long time, but now we have technology that I'm hopeful that we can actually finally crack the code on some of these really big enhancements that we see. But certainly, productivity is a big piece of it. I know I talked today about Agent Assist and this idea of call summarization. Again, it probably doesn't sound that exciting. But for someone who used to sit on the other side of that, you see whether it's a prospect call or a client call gets summarized and recapped into a very quick format that's usable. These are hours and minutes of time. Even on the seller side, we actually are launching something called rapid pre-call planning. And I think about the hours I used to spend 27 years ago, researching a company to get myself ready to go in and have a conversation with a prospect that brings value, enabling our sellers to have all of that productivity. So I think it's, again, it's too early to give you exact hundreds of millions of dollars of types of quantifications. But arguably, we are actively looking kind of case by case and really picking the ones that we believe sequentially will be the most accretive to drive the most amount of productivity, the most amount of value back to our shareholders, but candidly, the most amount of value to our clients.OperatorWe have time for one more question, and that question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.Scott Darren WurtzelJust on the launch of the construction vertical software, I'm just wondering, is this sort of part of a bigger shift to develop more vertical-specific HCM solutions for your clients? I understand construction may be a more complex vertical, but wondering if there's more of a vertical-specific strategy that could develop beyond the construction vertical.Maria BlackSo I like what you're suggesting, and I think the answer to that could be yes. And I think when I think about back to selling 27 years ago, I used to sell construction companies, and the complexity that they have has always existed. And candidly, a lot of the features and functionality that we have and are now pulling together to make it an actual solution for that vertical existed many years ago. And that's everything from things like job costing, obviously, compliance and reporting, think about certified compliance type of reports for payroll, things of that nature. And so it's really about pulling it together and marrying it with a service organization that can support the complexity of that vertical. I think that, to me, is a big change. So we did add some features. But a lot of these things we've had and we pulled them together, and we're marrying it with the ecosystem of a dedicated service org that can actually really help the construction industry. And this vertical saw the complexity of being in that industry. So I think what I would offer is that it's an exciting time for the construction industry, specifically for our Workforce Now clients. And I see that, just as you suggested, as the beginning of other places that we could pull together our existing tech with a dedicated type of service model and solve real challenges in the business for various verticals.Scott Darren WurtzelGot it. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Just wondering if you can give an update on sort of Next Gen HCM and Next Gen Payroll attach rates and how we're sort of trending there relative to expectations.Maria BlackSo Next Gen Payroll, that was the question?Danyal HussainBoth.Maria BlackBoth. Okay, just making sure I heard it right. So I think I touched base really quickly on Next Gen HCM, and I think I nodded to the excitement that we have that we continue to see the strength in the Next Gen HCM offering into Q1. So we had a strong fourth quarter. What I would suggest is that we actually brought in more Next Gen HCM in the first quarter than we saw all of last fiscal year. But again, one quarter of these things can sometimes be lumpy. But I think, for me, it's really about the sentiment. And so we recently had an Analyst Day. We had a handful of our clients up on stage that shared with us the impact the platform is making for them. And as you would remember, we spent a lot of our discussions over the last year talking about scaling implementation, onboarding the backlog. So it's pretty exciting to see some of that backlog that's no longer backlog on stage, speaking to the value proposition, and that's supported by continued strength, which means our sellers are excited to continue to sell the Next Gen HCM offering. So I think that's all very, very positive. Similarly, we have continued focus in the Next Gen Payroll. And so what I would offer there is we continue to make headway. So as you know, it's not deployed across the entire mid-market. We continue to make headway to solve for more complex features, things of that nature, that will pull it further into the up market of the mid-market. But as you know, that Next Gen Payroll engine is also what's attached to the Roll offer. So the other exciting part about that N Gen is it is the thing that's taking us into the SMB space internationally. So I feel really excited about the road map for that offering and the contributions that it's making into the mid-market today, but also into the long-term growth of the company internationally.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Maria Black for closing remarks.Maria BlackYes. So thank you, Michelle. And listen, it's hard for me not to sit here and reflect on a year ago. And so I was driving in this morning and feeling candidly a bit nostalgic because it's exactly 1 year ago that Carlos and I sat here and announced the transition of me becoming CEO of this amazing company. And so I'm incredibly nostalgic and proud today. I'm proud of our first quarter results. I'm really proud of the execution of the team, both with respect to the results, but also with everything that you heard in terms of the progress we are making on a very cohesive and strong strategic outline and priorities. But mostly what I would offer is that I remain incredibly humbled by the over 60,000 associates that I've had an opportunity to engage with over the last year, who continue to make this company everything that it is and absolutely amazing. And I just wanted to say that I'd like to thank each and every one of them for inspiring me every day. So with that, that is the conclusion of our call, and until we meet again.OperatorThank you for your participation. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.""]"

The company, with over 250 dealerships and 53 collision centers across 20 states, primarily in Sunbelt metropolitan areas, reported a revenue of $27 billion in 2022. The company's revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was $20,181.5 million, a slight decrease from $20,288.0 million in the same period in 2022. The company's net income also decreased from $1,091.0 million to $804.9 million in the same period. This SWOT analysis will delve into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) faces based on the details provided in the 10-Q filing.StrengthsBrand Power and Market Presence: AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) has established a strong brand presence in the automotive industry. The company's extensive network of dealerships, collision centers, and parts distribution centers across 20 states provides it with a significant market presence, particularly in the Sunbelt metropolitan areas.

This diversification allows the company to cater to a wide range of customer needs, thereby enhancing its competitive advantage and revenue potential.Story continuesWeaknessesDependence on Certain Markets: AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) generates approximately 63% of its total retail new vehicle unit sales from its stores in Florida, Texas, and California. This heavy reliance on these markets makes the company vulnerable to economic downturns or regulatory changes in these states.Concentration of Suppliers: AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) relies heavily on a few major vehicle manufacturers for its new vehicles. Any adverse event related to these manufacturers could significantly impact the company's business operations and financial performance.OpportunitiesExpansion of AutoNation USA Stores: AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) has the opportunity to expand its AutoNation USA used vehicle stores, which play an integral part of the company's long-term growth plans. The company opened four new stores during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and has over 20 stores under development.Growth of Auto Finance Business: The company's captive auto finance company, AutoNation Finance, provides financing to qualified retail customers on certain vehicles.

These factors could impact the demand for AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN)'s products and services, thereby affecting its financial performance.Regulatory Changes: AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) operates in an industry that is subject to numerous laws and regulations. Changes in these laws and regulations could increase the company's compliance costs and affect its business operations.In conclusion, AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) has a strong market presence and a diversified range of product and service offerings, which are key strengths. However, the company's dependence on certain markets and suppliers is a notable weakness. The company has opportunities for growth through the expansion of its AutoNation USA stores and its auto finance business. However, it also faces threats from market volatility and regulatory changes. The company needs to leverage its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and mitigating its threats to maintain its competitive position in the automotive industry.This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

I'm going to start on Slide 3, and I'm going to provide some opening remarks before Tom takes you through the third quarter results in great detail. So as we all know, there continues to be mixed economic signals in the economy. But despite concerns of affordability, consumer demand for vehicles remains relatively healthy. And during the quarter, partly because of improved new vehicle supply and stable used vehicle inventory, we saw double digit year-over-year growth in new vehicle sales and strong sequential growth in used vehicle volume. And frankly, this is the first time in eight consecutive quarters that we've seen growth in combined new and used vehicle volumes for automation.Story continuesSo I think that's very positive. We also continue to see significant benefits of our clear focus on after sales, which delivered a record quarter for revenue and margin, and as a result, AutoNation delivered a solid performance in this evolving operating environment. So I'm just going to quickly look at the performance by business, and I'll start with new vehicle sales, where volume was up 12% in total and 9.5% on a same store basis. And as forecasted, new vehicle margin was down sequentially in the quarter but remained above $4,000 a unit. Now during the quarter, we did see some mix impact on our margin and that was driven by significant year-over-year volume growth in our import franchises, which benefited from improved inventory flow, releasing some of the pent-up demand for those brands.And I'll touch on the inventory numbers in a minute. But basically, everything that we got, we sold. So we saw quite a large increase in our import dealership volumes in the quarter. But I would say our sales teams tend to look at every potential deal in a very balanced way. And you'll see our combined margin performance across new and used, which included CFS income held up very well. And in fact, it's relative to the industry in the quarter and remains well above pre-pandemic levels. I mentioned other inventory levels, so let me touch on that. Obviously, they've increased from a year ago, but they remain less than 35 days supply but we have a lot of variation, frankly, among branding categories. We have 51 days of domestic brands. So that probably answers one of the questions about what's happening in my previous time [indiscernible].So we have 51 days domestic brands as we said, 33 days of luxury and 17 days of import brands. Now moving on to used vehicles. As you'll recall, at the beginning of the year, we spent some time talking about the fact that used vehicle inventory would be harder to source and obviously critical to success this year. So knowing that we've made continued investments to maintain and grow used vehicle inventory, I think the team in the quarter did a good job sourcing retail quality used vehicles and to facilitate this, we've increased our investment and we buy your car marketing and infrastructure, which you're obviously going to see in our SG&A. In addition, we have our teams looking at every potential sale in a much more holistic way considering not just the vehicle margin but also the income from CFS and additional consideration as the sale yield of retailable trade.Now as a result, used inventory has been stable, which has helped us post the sequential used vehicle sales increase of over 5%, which would not be possible without the daily focus on vehicle sourcing which, by the way, resulted in over 90% of our total used vehicles being self sourced in the quarter. Now as you know vehicle volume new and used is important for many reasons, but a key one for us is our industry leading performance and customer financial services, which again continued to deliver in the quarter. And then the team has done a great job to overcome a significantly higher interest rate environment and lower finance penetration by continuing to maintain and grow product sales per unit sold. Now moving on to after sales. Here, the business continues to be one of our brightest spots.Revenue was up 12% and our gross profit was up 14%. The greater complexity of vehicles is leading to higher values per repair order and we've also been keenly focused on growing our technician workforce, which is allowing us to serve more customers. I was also pleased with the operating cash generation in our business. It was another great quarter of cash conversion relative to net income, which Tom will no doubt talk more about later. But aside from the solid quarter from a financial perspective, there are a few other highlights I'd like to touch on before handing over. Our 11 million plus customers are our core focus and we're extending our product offerings and reach into more recurring revenue streams and we're adding new customers every day across all of our channels.And during the quarter, we increased the penetration of automation finance at our AN USA stores, where we are now financing roughly one in four AN USA vehicle sales and we have also expanded into our franchise stores. So AutoNation Finance continues to be integrated as a thoughtful and measured place and is, in fact, ahead of where we thought it would be, which is why we expanded it to our franchise businesses. We're also actively launching supplementary products and services to meet our customers' needs, which supports consumer vehicle usage and also attracts new customers to us. And we launched a micro lease business called AutoNation Mobility and an e-commerce parts and accessory platform called autonationparts.com. These businesses, along with AutoNation's recently acquired mobile repair service complements our traditional dealership model while expanding our reach into the transportation industry.We expanded our AutoNation USA footprint with our 17th store in Hilton Head Island, and this was the fourth opening of the year, and we expect four more openings in the fourth quarter, including our Fort Myers facility, which opened this week. Now as you can imagine, it's not an easy task to get these greenfield businesses open and up and running. And I'd like to congratulate and thank the teams that continue to work incredibly hard on this. I'm also pleased to say that so far these businesses are selling ahead of plan and are showing considerable growth year-over-year. And by the way, since with this project with AN USA has started they've now sold over 70,000 vehicles. So that's not out for organic growth, I think. So moving on. The exceptional service we provide to our customers did not go unnoticed as AutoNation was recognized as the top public franchise dealer group by reputation of 2023 automotive reputation report, and that's an honor that we have housed four out of the last five years.And of course, that is only possible because of the 24,000 dedicated AutoNation associates who work tirelessly in our business and whom I would like to thank. So thank you all for listening, and I thank you in person as I get out into the business model. And finally, we were named best companies to work for list by U.S. News and World. So you can see customers at the central what we do. We are focused on growth, outstanding customer service and operational excellence through our business. And we're also looking to the future how the industry will evolve and what the needs of our customers will be. There is clearly an opportunity for automation to capitalize on our strong brand and footprint to retain and reactivate customers and provide them with more value and garner a larger share of wallet over a longer period of time.And now Tom will take you through the financials in greater detail. Tom?Tom Szlosek: Yes. Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everybody. A more detailed outline of our Q3 highlights is on Slide 4 of the materials. New revenue vehicle was up 11% at $3.2 billion. Volumes in new vehicle were up 12% and including, as Mike mentioned, 25% on imports and 5% on domestic with luxury, roughly flat volume line. Same store volumes were up 9% and revenue per vehicle retail was stable. Used vehicle revenue declined 10% year-over-year with US sales down roughly 4% and revenue per vehicle retail down 6%. Importantly, as Mike mentioned, though, used vehicle sales improved unit wise by over 5% compared with the second quarter. So the efforts of our investments are starting to pay dividends. So Customer Financial Services revenue increased 2% to $370 million.An AutoNation-branded dealership, showcasing the wide variety of new and used vehicles on offer.This reflects the increase in total retail volume from 2022 and fairly stable CFS revenue PVRs. After sales was up 12% to $1.2 billion in revenue, the result of both higher value repair orders as well as improving volumes. After sales gross profit margins were up 14% in the business. Third quarter earnings per share were $5.54, down 8% while operating income was down 16% and interest expense up $44 million, our EPS was favorably impacted by a more than 20% decline in the share count, which obviously is a reflection of our ongoing share repurchase actions. Cash from operations, as Mike mentioned, was very strong through September. It's up -- we were at $763 million, which resulted in conversion on net income of more than 95%. So the company has really impressed me in my first few days -- first few months in terms of doing the right things to drive cash generation, including the management of work capital.Mike also mentioned the integration of AutoNation Finance. This is still a pretty small business for us with roughly a $400 million portfolio but we expect significant growth as we increase the penetration of financing in our stores. As part of these efforts, we've discontinued all third party originations and are now exclusively focused on the AutoNation business. In September, AN Finance represented roughly a quarter of the loan originations in AN USA stores, as Mike mentioned. We've also commenced lending in our franchise stores. And in for the third quarter, as planned, we sold most of our lower credit tier loans from the legacy CIG portfolio, which generated a pretax gain of $8 million. Turning to Slide 5 for some commentary on our third quarter P&L, on balance, the strength in new vehicle unit volumes and after sales and the stability in customer financial services more than offset the decline we experienced in new vehicle PVRs and used vehicle revenue.And in this environment, we're very pleased with the 3% growth in top line from 2022. Gross profit was slightly lower in nominal terms. All in, we were down roughly 90 basis points in gross profit margin to 19%, reflecting the moderation in new vehicle gross profit PVRs but that was largely offset by growth in the aftersales gross profit, as I mentioned. Adjusted SG&A increased 7% to $823 million with generally stable core spending and incremental costs to relate to our growth initiatives, and I'll touch on that a bit more later. Third quarter floor plan interest expense of $38 million was up from $11 million in the third quarter of 2022, that's a reflection of both higher rates and borrowings, higher borrowings and it's about half and half in terms of the impact.For non-vehicle debt, the interest expense was $49 million, which was up from $34 million a year ago. And again, both higher rates and increased borrowings impacted the interest and expenses as well. Our income tax rate was stable at 25%. So all in, this resulted in $244 million of net income compared to $336 million a year ago. And as I mentioned, our average shares outstanding of $44 million, we're more than 20% lower than a year ago. This meaningfully blunted the EPS effects of the net income decline as you can see. Starting on Slide 6, I'd like to build on the color Mike gave on the performance in our various revenue categories for the third quarter. As you said, new vehicle volumes were up 12% and this includes over 25% on imports. Revenue PVRs have remained stable for new vehicles.Gross PVRs continue to moderate, reflecting increased availability of new vehicles and importantly, as Mike mentioned, our intentionality in pursuing higher volumes to drive the other parts of the business. New vehicle inventory levels have increased more than 50% in both units and values from a year ago, and new units have grown from roughly 13,000 units to over 27,000 units. In used vehicles, on Slide 7, we had a modest volume decline of 4% from a year ago with the most pronounced declines from our domestic stores, which decreased 10%, important luxury stores had less pronounced volume decline. As Mike mentioned, we have seen some nice progress since the second quarter with used vehicle volumes up 5% sequentially. And this was more than twice the market's growth.There was good traction quarter-over-quarter in the $40,000 and below pricing tiers. Those tiers comprise more than 80% of our unit sales. And even on the higher priced tiers greater than 40,000, which has better profitability, the growth was also respectable at roughly 2%. The demand is clearly there and we're continuing our initiatives to pursue more supply. Revenue and gross profit [TBRs] and used vehicles were both down year-over-year, mostly reflecting the volume decline and the mix of sales by pricing tier. Used vehicle inventory levels were overall stable at 33 days with growth in lower priced tiers very strong, offset by declines in higher priced tiers. We continue to emphasize health sourcing including trade-ins, lease expiries as well as our [iBuyer] car initiative for the quarter, our self-sourcing represented 96% of used vehicles acquired.Now moving on to Slide 8. In Customer Financial Services, we delivered 2% revenue increase, roughly in line with vehicle sales unit growth for the quarter. For new vehicles, higher unit volumes and stronger penetration of both finance and nonfinance products are driving stronger CFF. On the used side, a portion of our sales with finance products declined modestly year-over-year given the interest rate environment, but still remains very high at close to 70% penetration. On nonfinancial products, we also had a similar modest decline but still very respectable penetration. On Slide 9, after sales, as I mentioned, up 12% in revenue at $1.2 billion. Customer pay, warranty, internal and collision all experienced double digit growth year-over-year.So it was very broad across the entire portfolio. The value per order is improving, and the number of repair orders had also increased. And we're starting to see the benefit from the investment in additional technicians. I think we've made over the course of the last few months. Our gross profit grew 14% year-over-year and our gross profit margins were up more than 80 basis points to 47%. And again, this is a reflection of those higher value repair orders as well as the scale benefits we're starting to benefit from in terms of the increase in the number of orders. A quick comment on the UAW strike. We obviously hope this is resolved in mutually agreeable manner. We've been preemptively building inventory where we can and after sales with the support of OEMs. In the third quarter, there was not much of a financial impact apart from the slight inventory build.We obviously are monitoring the situation closely. Slide 10, Operating income was 6% for the quarter, down from last year, but still much higher than like 200 basis points higher from pre-pandemic levels. The decrease from ‘22 reflects the moderation in new vehicle gross profit per vehicle as well as higher SG&A. And the growth in SG&A reflects investments for growth, including the supporting infrastructure for our AutoNation USA stores as well as for our aftermarket business. We've also had some increased advertising spend related to acquisition of vehicles via [Valayar] car initiative. There's been some inflation and some self-insurance costs for weather related losses. Overall, normalized SG&A as a percent of gross profit, we do expect to remain lower than pre-pandemic levels.Slide 11. Our operating cash flow generation remains very robust. We were at 105% conversion of net income for the quarter. Our cash flow from operations was $256 million in the third quarter and we increased our non-trade floor plan by $89 million and our CapEx was $87 million. So together, these have resulted in free cash flow of $258 million for the third quarter. CapEx for the quarter was up around 10%, reflecting a steadily increasing reinvestment ratio, where we're now at roughly 1.6 times depreciation. And the principal year-over-year increase in CapEx that drove that 10% has mostly been for growth, including the AN USA expansion, some facility spending for electric vehicles and some IT related projects. Slide 12 shows our capital allocation for the first nine months of 2022 and 2023.Last year, our capital allocation focus was on reinvesting in the business and share repurchases. Since the beginning of 2022, in fact, we've repurchased roughly 21 million shares, which is more than third of our outstanding share count. It was a low interest rate environment. We are enjoying recovery driven cash flows. The M&A landscape wasn't presenting deals we viewed as attractive and we had a dislocation in our share price. And while we still believe in the longer term value that would be great in our share price, over the course of '23 as interest rates have increased and our cash flows have normalized, we've moderated the level of share repurchase activity still. When you look at it as a percentage of free cash flow, the share repurchases are relatively stable, close to 100% of free cash flow.At quarter end, our leverage was 2 times EBITDA. This is at the low end of our 2 to 3 times target. Michael and I very comfortable with where we sit there. And moving forward, we'll continue to allocate capital to maximize shareholder value. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike to wrap things up.Mike Manley: Yes. Thanks, Tom. I'm just going to, again, before we go to the Q&A session, thank all of our associates in the business. And as I said, I think that there's been a lot of progress in terms of putting infrastructure in place, building new offerings, products and services for our customers as well, and that will take tremendous effort. So thank you all. And with that, let's start the Q&A.Derek Fiebig: Ellen, if you could please prompt the audience how to get in the queue.See also 12 Best Autonomous Trucking and Vehicle Stocks To Buy Now and 11 Best BDC Stocks To Buy For the Rest of 2023.To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here."", 'Yahoo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill be right back...\nThank you for your patience.\nOur engineers are working quickly to resolve the issue.\n\n\n', 'Yahoo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill be right back...\nThank you for your patience.\nOur engineers are working quickly to resolve the issue.\n\n\n', ""ANZacks Equity ResearchOctober 27, 2023 at 6:30 AM·3 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowANFor the quarter ended September 2023, AutoNation (AN) reported revenue of $6.89 billion, up 3.4% over the same period last year.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Walmart (WMT) earns a Zacks Rank #2 14 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 16, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.52 a share.WMT has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.02%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.52 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50.WMT is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. AutoZone (AZO) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.AutoZone, which is readying to report earnings on December 5, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $31.32 a share, and AZO is 33 days out from its next earnings report.AutoZone's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 2.61% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30.52.Story continuesWMT and AZO's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Shares have added about 1.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is AutoZone due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.AutoZone Q4 Earnings & Sales Beat EstimatesAutoZone\xa0reported earnings of $46.46 per share for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Aug 26, 2023), up 14.7% year over year.

Also, rental income of $724.1 million lagged the consensus mark of $728 million. Results reflect a weak performance in its West Coast markets, along with the Rite Aid bankruptcy.According to Mark J. Parrell, Equity Residential’s president and CEO, “While the East Coast outperformed our expectations, the San Francisco and Seattle markets underperformed due to lower recent job growth in our target affluent renter demographic and, together with the Rite Aid bankruptcy, led us to adjust guidance.”Parrell also noted that with respect to delinquency, the legal process is lengthy and uneven and “we will likely end the year with modestly more delinquency than our previous goal.”However, on a year-over-year basis, normalized FFO per share increased 4.3%, with rental income climbing 4.2%.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues were up 4.1% year over year. Our estimate for same-store revenue growth was 4.2%. Same-store expenses flared up 3.1%, and consequently, same-store net operating income (NOI) climbed 4.6% year over year.The average rental rate increased 5% year over year to $3,048 in the quarter ended September. Meanwhile, the physical occupancy contracted 40 basis points (bps) to 96% for the same-store portfolio. Our estimate for the same was 96.1%.Same-store residential revenues were up 4.4% year over year, while expenses increased 3.1%. Consequently, same-store residential NOI expanded 5.1% year over year.The new lease change for its residential same-store properties was up 0.5%, while the renewal rate achieved by EQR was 5.5% for the third quarter. The blended rate for the quarter was 3.1%. The physical occupancy for this portfolio was 96%, up 10 basis points (bps) sequentially.In the third quarter, Equity Residential acquired two operating properties in suburban Atlanta. These included a recently completed 344-unit apartment property in Suwanee, currently in lease-up, for $98 million at a stabilized acquisition cap rate of 5.4% and a 290-unit property in Decatur built in 2019 for $81.7 million at an acquisition cap rate of 5.1%. Also, during the quarter, EQR sold a 166-unit property in Seattle for $60.1 million at a disposition yield of 5.4%, generating an unlevered IRR of 7.5%.Story continuesBalance SheetEquity Residential exited the third quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $39.3 million, down from the $53.9 million recorded at the end of 2022.The net debt to normalized EBITDAre was 4.24X, which decreased from 4.27X in the previous quarter. The unencumbered NOI as a percentage of the total NOI was 89.8% in the quarter, up from 88.5% reported in the prior quarter.GuidanceFor the fourth quarter of 2023, EQR projects normalized FFO per share in the band of $0.99-$1.01. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.00.For 2023, Equity Residential revised its outlook for normalized FFO per share to the $3.77-$3.79 band from its earlier guidance in the band of $3.77-$3.83, down 2 cents at the midpoint. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.79.For the full year, EQR expects same-store revenue growth of 5.5%, reflecting a decrease of 0.375% from the prior guidance at the midpoint, while same-store expense growth is reaffirmed at 4.25%. Consequently, the same-store NOI growth projection is revised to 6.2%, down 45 bps at the midpoint. Moreover, physical occupancy is now expected at 95.9%, down 10 bps from the prior projection of 96%.Equity Residential currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NYSE:AVB) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript October 26, 2023Operator: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your host for today’s conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.Jason Reilley: Thank you, Rob, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon’s press release as well as in the company’s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today’s discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.An aerial view of a large real estate brokerage office.And with that, I will turn the call over to Ben Schall, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Ben?Ben Schall: Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. In keeping with our custom, we posted a presentation last night to accompany our earnings release. In addition to my opening comments, you will hear from Sean on our operating performance and revenue building blocks for 2024; from Matt on the significant earnings being generated by our development projects and lease-up; and from Kevin on the strength of our balance sheet. I want to start with my thanks to the AvalonBay team and our 3000-plus associates for delivering another strong quarter of financial performance and operating results. Particularly in the current environment of higher interest rates and uncertain cap rates, we are laser-focused on driving cash flow growth from our portfolio.Story continuesThe bottom line results from our operating model transformation led by our on-site and centralized teams and powered by our technology, revenue management and data science teams and proprietary systems continue to outpace expectations. Our strong operating performance also speaks to our portfolio positioning, which is 70% suburban and primarily in suburban coastal markets, which continue to benefit from a combination of steady demand and limited new supply. Turning to Slide 4 in the presentation. We grew core FFO by 6.4% in Q3, which was $0.06 ahead of our expectations. This outperformance was primarily driven by better-than-expected revenue growth, which positions us well, as we enter the traditional slower leasing season. As shown on the bottom of Slide 4, we have raised $855 million of capital this year at a 4.3% initial cost, which includes the drawdown of our $500 million equity forward, which we priced at $250 per share and with the remainder coming from asset sales that we've sold at an average cap rate of 4.7%.We completed three development projects in Q3, two in suburban submarkets in the Northeast and one in Miami at a 7.2% stabilized yield. As Matt will emphasize later, our lease-up communities continue to outperform our original expectations by a wide margin. These projects are funded with yesterday's capital, at yesterday's capital cost and are slated to generate outsized value creation and earnings for investors. We also started two projects this quarter, one in Princeton, New Jersey and one in South Miami, with projected yields in the mid-6% range. I will come back to our positioning on new development and capital allocation at the end of our prepared remarks. In Q3, we made $50 million of commitments under our structured investment program or SIP and feel fortunate to be building this book of business in today's environment with these new commitments generating an attractive 13% return.Slide five provides the breakdown of our Q3 revenue outperformance relative to guidance from the end of July with a 30 basis point uplift from higher-than-expected occupancy, 20 basis points from higher rates and 10 basis points from improving bad debt. Turning to slide six. We've exceeded and raised guidance three times this year. We now expect core FFO to grow 8.6% in 2023, which is 330 basis points above our initial expectations for the year. Same-store revenue growth expectations are up 130 basis points. Expenses are down slightly, leading to NOI growth of 6.3%. And with that, I'll turn it to Sean to comment on the favorable demand and supply drivers in our markets and provide a fuller operating update.Sean Breslin: Thanks, Ben. As we start to look forward to 2024, I thought I'd provide some initial thoughts on two topics. First, I'd like to highlight a few macro factors that will support the performance of our portfolio in the coming year. And then second, share a few building blocks as it relates to the outlook for 2024 revenue growth specifically. Starting on slide seven, we believe our portfolio is well positioned as it relates to rental affordability, particularly as compared to other regions of the country and single-family for sale product. In Chart 1, you can see that rental affordability in our established regions is actually better than pre-pandemic levels, given the strong wage growth that's been experienced over the last few years.And in Chart 2, difference between the cost of owning the median-price home and median rent in our established regions has increased by roughly 10x if you look at the first three quarters of 2023 relative to the average during 2020, which certainly makes apartment living in a more attractive option in these regions. We've already seen the impact of this trend in multiple data points. For example, the volume of existing home sales in our established regions has declined by roughly 25% over the past year. And in our own portfolio, the percentage of move-outs to purchase a home has dipped below 10% this year well below the mid-teens long-term average. Moving to slide eight. Our portfolio is also relatively insulated from new supply particularly as compared to the Sunbelt.In our established regions, we expect new multifamily deliveries of approximately 1.5% of existing stock. And in the specific submarkets where we own assets, new supply is projected to be roughly 1% of stock. This bodes well for revenue growth in all market cycles, but is a particularly valuable attribute of our portfolio, if we experience a weaker economic environment during 2024. Transitioning to slide nine, I'd like to highlight four specific building blocks for 2024 revenue growth. First, the embedded growth in the rent roll from leases we've executed during 2023 stands at approximately 1.5%, which is above our long-term average at this point of the year. Second, our current loss to lease is roughly 2%, led by the East Coast at about 2.5%, while the West Coast and expansion regions trailed behind at approximately 1.5% and 70 basis points respectively.Third, we continue to drive incremental revenue from our operating model initiatives. For example, the September revenue from our Avalon Connect offering was about 40% greater than the average monthly revenue for the first nine months of the year and that monthly revenue run rate will continue to grow during the last two months of 2023 and throughout 2024. Lastly we're expecting a continued tailwind from the normalization of bad debt. During the first half of the year, underlying bad debt averaged approximately 2.7% as compared to the Q3 average of roughly 2% and we expect continued improvement as we move through 2024. The benefit from an improvement in underlying bad debt will be partially offset by the loss of rent relief we've recognized in 2023, but still be a net meaningful benefit for 2024.Taken together these building blocks should support healthy revenue growth during the upcoming year. So with that, I'll turn it over to Matt to address our lease-up activity and structured investment platform. Matt?Matt Birenbaum: All right. Thanks Sean. Turning to slide 10. Our lease-ups continue to deliver outstanding results, laying the foundation for strong future growth in both earnings and NAV. We have five development communities that had active leasing in Q3 and those five deals are leasing up at rents that are $485 per month or 17% above our initial underwriting. This in turn is driving a 90 basis point increase in the yield on these investments to 7.4% far above any estimate of current cap rates and even further above the cost of capital we sourced to fund these deals back when they broke ground several years ago. After a relatively light year of deliveries in 2023, we do expect to see a significant increase in our apartment completions in 2024, which will provide incremental NOI and FFO as these communities reach stabilization.Slide 11 provides an update on our structured investment program where we initiated two new investments last quarter and $52 million at an all-in average interest rate of 13%. As we've discussed on prior calls these are three to five-year investments where we provide capital to merchant builders that sits above the construction loan but below common equity in the capital structure. We're still early in the build up of this new line of business and expect it to continue to grow to roughly $400 million over the next few years, providing a nice tailwind to earnings growth as these dollars get invested and start earning a return. We're also fortunate that we're able to underwrite most of this business in today's more restrictive environment providing a strong risk-adjusted return particularly for the latest additions to the program.And with that I'll turn it over to Kevin.Kevin O’Shea: Thanks Matt. Turning to the next few slides. We continue to enjoy tremendous financial strength and flexibility both from a balance sheet and a liquidity perspective. Specifically from a balance sheet perspective as you can see on slide 12, we enjoy low leverage with net debt to EBITDA of 4.1 times, which is below our target range of five times to six times. Our interest coverage ratio and our unencumbered NOI percentage are at near record levels of 7.5 times and 95% respectively. Our debt maturities are well laddered with a weighted average years to maturity of 7.5 years. And our development underway is nearly 100% match-funded essentially with yesterday's lower cost of capital, which in turn helps ensure that these projects provide earnings and NAV growth when they are completed and stabilized.In addition from a liquidity perspective as shown on slide 13, we continue to maintain a high level of excess liquidity relative to our open commitments for development and structured investment products as of quarter end. Specifically we enjoy $1.5 billion of excess liquidity. And so as a result, we continue to enjoy tremendous financial strength and stability and the flexibility to pursue attractive growth opportunities that may emerge across our investment platforms in the coming months. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ben.Ben Schall: All right. Thanks, Kevin. We have consistently maintained a strong balance sheet throughout cycles. And as a result, we are well prepared for the current environment. As we have shown over the past couple of years, we proactively adjusted our capital sourcing and capital allocation activities based on changes in the environment as emphasized on slide 14. We locked in our equity forward in early 2022 to pre-fund future development activity. We shifted in the second half of 2022 and in 2023 to be a net seller of assets with a portion of the proceeds being utilized to fund acquisitions as we reshape the portfolio and the balance to fund accretive development. And we have continued to be responsive in adjusting our development start activity, reducing starts last year and this year as our cost of capital changed.As we've emphasized, we are 95% match funded on our development underway, which means all of that capital has already been raised at an attractive initial cost and allows us to deliver projects in 2024 and 2025 that will generate significant earnings and value. On a go-forward basis, we have raised our return requirements on new development. For a standard development deal, our target return was in the low to mid-6s in the middle of the year and is in the mid- to high 6s today. These target returns are up over 100 basis points since last year with the goal of underwriting 100 to 150 basis points of spread between development yields and market cap rates. We expect to be in the lower development -- we expect to be in a lower development start environment in the coming quarters and with spreads at the tighter end of this range after a number of years of outsized development profit margins.And while in the current environment we're focused on maintaining our balance sheet strength, we do believe that we are well positioned given our low leverage, ample liquidity and unique strategic capabilities to capitalize on opportunities that might result from market dislocations. In the near term, while volumes are modest, we're able to deploy capital at double-digit returns through our SIP program. Slide 15 concludes our prepared remarks with our key takeaways. We continue to deliver strong operating results with tailwinds specific to our suburban coastal markets incremental NOI to come from our developments and lease-up and all supported by a fantastic balance sheet.
