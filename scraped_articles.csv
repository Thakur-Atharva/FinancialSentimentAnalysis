META,"The S&P 500 started 2024 with a solid 4.5% rise, following a successful 2023. The main question for investors is: are these gains transient, or is this the start of another lasting bull market?
Market legend and billionaire asset manager, Ken Fisher, has been watching current conditions, and he has some opinions about where we’re likely to go from here.
“A strong January for global stocks has not silenced doubters,” he says, and goes on, “Higher-for-longer interest rates! Global economic malaise! Escalating regional wars! You know all the reasons bears say this bull market is definitively doomed, extending their 2023 arguments. Wrong again. Markets move on what people do not widely know and watch – surprises, positive or negative. This year, those surprises will be to the upside – shocking everyone again, like 2023.”
But words are cheap, and money talks, so let’s take a look at two of the mega-cap tech stocks that Fisher has been buying into – Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) – in anticipation of solid upside gains this year. A closer look may show us why Fisher is willing to buy big.
Nvidia
First up, on our list of Fisher’s picks, is Nvidia, the fast-growing leader in the semiconductor chip industry. Nvidia is currently the third-largest publicly traded company in the world – behind only Microsoft and Apple. The stock has been rising at a fast pace over the past several years; it is up more than 250% in the last 12 months.
The main driver of Nvidia’s success in recent years has been the high quality of the company’s chipset products. Nvidia has long been a leader in the GPU segment, and these chips, originally designed to meet the processing needs of high-end computer graphic programs, have found ready audiences among computer gamers, professional graphic designers, data center operators, and – more recently – in AI applications. Each of these fields requires high capacity chips, and Nvidia has built a reputation as the go-to name for those users.
The data center industry has been a particularly bright spot for Nvidia. The company’s market share in GPUs for the data center industry provides about 83% of the Nvidia’s total revenues. In raw numbers, Nvidia reported $18.4 billion in sales to data centers in its fiscal 4Q24 report. That marked a year-over-year increase of 409%.
Overall, Nvidia’s fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 saw a total top line of $22.1 billion, a company record and a 265% y/y increase. Q4 revenues were also $1.55 billion better than had been expected. At the bottom line, Nvidia realized earnings of $5.16 per share in non-GAAP EPS; this beat the forecast by 52 cents per share.
As for billionaire investor Ken Fisher, he is clearly bullish on Nvidia. In the last calendar-year quarter, 4Q23, he bought 594,243 shares of the stock, bringing his total holding in NVDA to 8,943,979 shares. At current prices, Fisher’s holding in Nvidia shares is valued at $6.58 billion.
In addition to Ken Fisher, Nvidia has caught the eye of Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah. The 5-star expert is upbeat on Nvidia, basing his stance on the company’s solid data center business, it’s exposure to the growing AI industry, and its potential to continue realizing outsized gains.
“Our work suggests NVDA has material upside to Street revenue and EPS through CY2024/FY2025 and into / through CY2025/FY2026 (Figures 1 & 3) driven by Data Center GPUs). Specifically we’re looking for revenue & EPS CY2024/FY2025 & CY2025/ FY2026 of $132.4B & $30.00 (vs Street of $95.8B & $21.76) and $175.6B & $40.00 (vs Street of $110B & $24.84). We also believe there is legitimate upside potential to even our above Street estimates via both revenue and GM expansion. For those looking at quarterly trends … NVDA’s 1. Quarterly results vs Street and 2. Guidance vs. Street, which shows a distinct pattern of pronounced beats and raises since Gen AI kicked off 12 months ago,” Baruah opined.
Quantifying this stance, Baruah puts a Buy rating on NVDA shares, along with a $1,200 price target that implies a robust 63% gain in the next 12 months. (To watch Baruah’s track record, click here)
High-end tech stocks never fail to gain love from Wall Street, and Nvidia shares have 38 recent reviews from the Street’s analysts. These reviews include 36 Buys and just 2 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See Nvidia stock forecast)
Meta Platforms
The next stock we’re looking at is Meta, the parent company of Facebook and the most recent member of the ‘trillion-dollar club.’ Despite boasting a market cap of $1.21 trillion, making it the smallest of these mega-caps, Meta still holds the position as the world’s sixth-largest public company.
In addition to Facebook, its flagship social media concern, Meta also owns Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. In the company’s last quarterly report, covering Q4 and the full year 2023, Meta reported increased audiences across all of its social media platforms. For December 2023, the company had a DAP – family daily active people – totaling 3.19 billion, marking an 8% year-over-year increase; for the month, the monthly active people (MAP) were up 6% to 3.98 billion. Facebook makes up the largest share of this audience – the platform saw 2.11 billion daily active users in December 2023, marking a 6% increase year-over-year. Facebook’s monthly active users (MAUs) grew by 3% year-over-year to reach 3.07 billion.
For Meta, active users are a key metric. The company leverages these numbers to generate revenue from advertising, and in 4Q23, Meta generated $40.11 billion in total revenues, marking a 25% year-over-year increase and surpassing expectations by $940 million. Annual revenue was up by 16%, reaching $134.9 billion. The company’s quarterly EPS, by GAAP measures, amounted to $5.33 per share, exceeding the forecast by 39 cents per share. Shares in META have gained more than 33% so far this year, and approximately 175% over the past 12 months.
While these figures represent solid returns, for return-minded investors, there is an even better option. In its quarterly report, Meta announced the initiation of a regular quarterly dividend. The first payment is set at 50 cents per share, scheduled for a March 26 payout. The annualized rate of $2 provides a modest forward yield of 0.42%. The key point here is not the current yield, but the stronger commitment to capital return. The dividend announcement was accompanied by a $50 billion increase in the company’s share repurchase authorization.
All of this provides an interesting backdrop to Ken Fisher’s heavy buy-in to Meta. In 4Q23, the billionaire added 414,520 META shares to his portfolio; his total stake in Meta now stands at 5,456,958 shares, worth $2.55 billion.
Turning to the analysts, we’ll check in with Tigress Financial’s 5-star analyst, Ivan Feinseth, who sees Meta’s lead in social media and inroads to AI as key points for the stock.
“META is well-positioned to benefit from ongoing innovation; increasing AI functionality integration and new product introductions will drive further increases in user engagement and ongoing acceleration of revenue growth. META continues to benefit from its dominant digital advertising position and growing user engagement. META’s ongoing advertising success continues to be driven by its strong click-to-action conversion, reflecting improvements in advertising performance due to engaging in-platform advertising experiences connecting advertisers with their marketing data and leveraging AI across its advertising platform,” Feinseth opined.
To this end, Feinseth gives META shares a Strong Buy rating with a $575 target price, implying a 23% gain by the end of this year. (To watch Feinseth’s track record, click here)
From the Street generally, there are 41 recent reviews of META stock, breaking down to 38 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell for a Strong Buy consensus. The shares are trading for $468.03, with a $529.02 average price target pointing toward a 13% potential upside on the one-year horizon. (See Meta stock forecast)

- Corporate law typically shields executives from personal liability, though there are exceptions.
- If Zuckerberg is personally dropped from the lawsuits, it wouldn't dismiss cases against Meta.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is arguing he can't be held personally liable for accusations that his platforms have led to kids being addicted to social media — and he may have a point.
Zuckerberg's legal team was in court in Oakland, California, this week over a string of lawsuits filed against Meta and him personally by parents and schools that allege his actions and Meta's have harmed children by causing social media addiction, NBC Bay Area reported.
Zuckerberg has requested he personally be dropped from the two dozen lawsuits, which were filed by people from over a dozen states. A ruling in the billionaire's favor would excuse him from being held personally liable but would not dismiss the cases against Meta.
The lawsuits claim that Zuckerberg's actions and inaction led to social media addiction and accused him of ignoring warnings that Facebook and Instagram were unsafe for kids.
In court records viewed by Business Insider, Zuckerberg's lawyers said, ""It is a fundamental principle that individuals cannot be held personally liable for the acts or omissions of a corporation based merely on their status as corporate executives, directors, or shareholders.""
His lawyers reiterated their arguments in court on Friday, saying there is a clear difference between what Zuckerberg as an individual is personally liable for and his role as CEO, NBC Bay Area reported.
Lawyers for Zuckerberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.
In corporate law, executives are typically shielded from personal liability, Bloomberg noted Friday.
The ""corporate veil"" — which generally refers to distinctions between a business and its owners — shields executives in most circumstances, although there are exceptions, according to an article from the law firm Oberheiden P.C.
Some situations in which executives can face liability include criminal acts and intentional or grossly negligent noncompliance. They can also face liability in lawsuits filed by third parties against a CEO, Oberheiden P.C. wrote, noting, ""In these lawsuits, plaintiffs are not seeking to hold CEOs liable for corporate acts (or purportedly corporate acts), but instead for acts undertaken by CEOs in their individual capacities.""
In other words, when a civil lawsuit is filed against a CEO over an action they personally took.
The plaintiffs argued in court that Zuckerberg had a duty to share findings related to social media risks for kids publicly, but US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers seemed skeptical of the argument, Bloomberg reported.
However, the outlet reported the judge did suggest if it's determined Meta had a duty to disclose that information, then it's possible the CEO could be held liable for concealing it.
""If Mark Zuckerberg knew the depth and breadth to which children were harmed on a daily basis by accessing and being addicted to the platforms that he is in charge of and did not take meaningful and significant action to remedy those harms, then he should be held personally liable,"" Titania Jordan of Bark Technologies, an online safety and parental controls company, told NBC Bay Area.
She added: ""Now, if he can claim plausible deniability or if he was made aware of this and instructed his team to make it better or make it safer and they didn't, then that is on the company.""
If Zuckerberg is deemed personally liable, it could have major implications for other lawsuits filed against CEOs of social media giants.","Someone get Mark Zuckerberg a gadget review YouTube channel, stat.
The Meta CEO on Monday posted a video review of Apple’s Vision Pro, the new rival mixed reality headset to Meta’s Quest 3.
“Alright, guys, so, I finally tried Apple’s Vision Pro,” Zuckerberg begins in the video, which was posted to his Instagram.
“Before this, I expected that Quest would be the better value for most people because it’s really good and it’s like seven times less expensive,” he said, referencing Quest 3’s $500 starting price tag compared to $3,500 for the Vision Pro. “But after using it, I don’t just think Quest is the better value, I think Quest is the better product, period.”
Reader, I know you didn’t see that coming.
Zuckerberg’s video, in which he sits on a couch and talks to the camera, was shot with a Quest 3 — the viewer is essentially seeing what the person wearing the headset was seeing, via the cameras on the outside of the device. It’s a feature on both devices called “passthrough,” and it’s one of the features that Apple promoted most aggressively ahead of the Vision Pro’s launch earlier this month.
The video shows that the headset wearer can see large digital screens that appear to be floating in space next to Zuckerberg — similar to how the Vision Pro was advertised, although perhaps in lower definition. Zuckerberg also throws several other jabs at the Vision Pro in an effort to talk up his own product.
Apple did not respond to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s video.
Here are the basics on each product:
• Meta Quest 3: A white, wireless headset with handheld controllers that Meta has advertised as great for playing immersive games, for a $500 starting price. Reviewers say the device is smaller and more comfortable than earlier Meta headsets. Meta also has a more advanced, and more expensive, headset option called Meta Quest Pro.
• Apple Vision Pro: A sleek headset reminiscent of ski goggles, with a wired attachment to an iPhone-sized battery pack but operated using hand and eye signals rather than controllers. Reviewers have lauded its familiar interface and 4K resolution screen, saying it’s unmatched for watching immersive videos and movies. But it doesn’t come cheap, with a $3,500 starting price.
At least for now, most consumers probably aren’t going to buy either the Quest 3 or the Vision Pro. Both mixed reality headsets are still relatively large, clunky and uncomfortable, and they have limited use cases that likely leave all but the biggest gadget enthusiasts wondering how they’d incorporate the devices into their daily lives.
But for both Meta and Apple, being viewed as the leader in the mixed reality space is crucial. The two companies see mixed reality as the future of computing, although their visions differ slightly. Meta believes the headsets will eventually let users spend large amounts of time in a still-largely-hypothetical digital world called the “metaverse,” while Apple seems to expect the device will one day augment users’ real-world lives just as the iPhone has in the nearly two decades since its launch. (So far, Meta’s metaverse has gained little traction, despite costing tens of billions of dollars, and the company has mostly moved on to talking about AI.)
The headset race is also just the latest moment in an ongoing rivalry between Meta and Apple. The tech giants have previously competed over news and messaging features, and their CEOs have traded jabs over data privacy and app store policies. In 2022, Meta said it expected to take a $10 billion hit that year from Apple’s move to limit how apps like Facebook collect data for targeted ads — a change that meant Meta had to spend years revamping its core ad business.
Meta has also been in the mixed reality headset game for years, and while the company has previously said it’s “always happy when more people join us in building the future,” it’s clear Zuckerberg doesn’t want to be outshined by Apple’s new entrant to the market.
“Now, look, I know that some fanboys get upset whenever anyone dares to question if Apple’s going to be the leader in a new category,” Zuckerberg said, before going on to critique what is often referred to as Apple’s “walled garden” approach to product development, where it controls the apps users can access on its devices and its products are mostly only interoperable with each other.
“The reality is that every generation of computing has an open and a closed model, and yeah, in mobile, Apple’s closed model won,” Zuckerberg said. “In this next generation, Meta is going to be the open model, and I really want to make sure that the open model wins out again.”
Zuckerberg did acknowledge a few of the things the Vision Pro does better, saying “Apple’s screen does have a higher resolution” and “Apple’s eye tracking is really nice.” He added that Meta planned to bring back its older eye tracking technology for future Quest products.
So, now we know what kinds of updates to expect from the eventual Meta Quest 4.",,"The new year hasn't brought much relief to the tech sector, as job cuts continue to dominate headlines. 2024 has already seen over thousands of tech workers laid off.
From giants like Meta and Amazon to promising startups, companies have shed thousands of employees. Reasons cited for the layoffs vary. Some, like Meta, point to pandemic-era overhiring and the need for ""efficiency."" Others, like Unity, a gaming software company, attribute it to restructuring and refocusing priorities.
The rise of automation and AI is also seen as a factor, with repetitive tasks becoming increasingly automated.
In a recent interview with Morning Brew Daily, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered his perspective on the wave of job cuts sweeping the tech industry. While acknowledging the pain caused by layoffs, Zuckerberg suggested a ""silver lining"" exists, with companies finding benefits in becoming ""leaner"" after pandemic-era overhiring. In 2023, Meta laid off thousands of employees.
""In terms of the layoffs, I actually think that was more due to companies trying to navigate Covid,"" Zuckerberg stated, downplaying the role of automation or specific technologies like AI.""At least for us, the AI stuff was not a major driver for that,"" the Meta CEO said. ""It was like first this overbuilding and then this sense of like let's do the best work we can by making a lean company.”
He explained that the pandemic boom in e-commerce fuelled rapid hiring sprees, but as the world adjusted, many companies realised they had become oversized.
This first wave of layoffs, according to Zuckerberg, was primarily about course correction. However, he went on to suggest that companies are now discovering advantages in operating with a smaller workforce. ""It was obviously really tough, we parted with a lot of talented people we cared about,"" he admitted in the interview, referencing Meta's own job cuts as part of its ""year of efficiency"" initiative. ""But in some ways actually becoming leaner kind of makes the company more effective.""",,,,,,,,
AAPL,"Better Tech Stock: Microsoft vs. Apple
Wall Street is particularly bullish about tech stocks now. Excitement about budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) and easing inflation sent the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index up 47% since last February.
As the world's two most valuable companies and leaders in tech, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have seen their shares rise 54% and 18% during the period. These companies are some of the most attractive ways to invest in the industry, with one a king in productivity software and the other leading the consumer tech market.
Microsoft and Apple have long histories of delivering consistent stock growth, and that looks unlikely to change. Over the last year, Microsoft emerged as one of the biggest names in AI. Meanwhile, Apple is home to a highly profitable services business and is gaining market share in the virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) industry.
So, let's examine these businesses and determine whether Microsoft or Apple is the better tech stock this February.
Microsoft
In January, Microsoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company, with its market cap at just over $3 trillion.
The company is a tech behemoth with positions in multiple areas of the industry, leading in productivity software, game consoles, cloud computing, and operating systems. Its diverse business model allows it to profit from tailwinds across tech, making its stock an exceptionally reliable option.
Since 2019, Microsoft's annual revenue climbed 68%, with operating income up 106%. Additionally, its free cash flow jumped 76% to $67 billion.
The company has significant cash reserves, allowing it to keep investing in its business and retain its prominent role in tech. Microsoft became a leader in AI after sinking billions into ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The partnership granted Microsoft access to some of the sector's most advanced AI models, which it used to carve out a lucrative position in the budding industry.
The AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, which would see it hit nearly $2 trillion before the end of the decade.
Meanwhile, Microsoft used OpenAI's technology to introduce AI features across its product lineup. In 2023, Microsoft added new AI tools to its Azure cloud platform, integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and boosted productivity in its Office software suite with the help of AI.
Apple
Apple hasn't had it as easy as Microsoft in the last year. In 2023, macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company, leading to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines.
The streak was finally broken in Apple's latest quarter, with revenue rising 2% year over year to $120 billion in the first quarter of 2024. The company beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.
However, outperforming estimates wasn't enough to quell investor concern over its iPhone business, with its stock down nearly 6% year to date. Smartphone sales rose 6% in Q1 2024, yet fell 13% in China. The country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market.
As a result, it's promising that the company is expanding its product lineup and prioritizing digital markets like services to lean less on iPhone sales over the long term.
The company released the Vision Pro, its first VR/AR headset, earlier this year. Launching at $3,499, the new device created significant hype for the technology. If the company employs a similar pricing strategy to that used with past products and brings down the cost with subsequent generations, an investment in Apple could be an investment in the future leader of the VR/AR market.
The VR market alone is expected to grow at a CAGR of 31% until at least 2030. It could be smart to invest in the tech giant at the very start of its journey into the industry.
Alongside free cash flow that hit $107 billion last year, Apple has the funds to overcome current headwinds and keep investing in high-growth areas of tech.
Is Microsoft or Apple the better tech stock?
Microsoft and Apple have exciting long-term outlooks, with opportunities to profit from multiple subsectors of tech.
However, Microsoft's more significant priority on digital markets like cloud computing and AI makes it less vulnerable to macroeconomic headwinds and potentially the more reliable buy.
Meanwhile, earnings-per-share estimates indicate Microsoft has more growth potential than Apple in the near term.
Microsoft's earnings could hit just under $16 per share, while Apple's may reach nearly $8 per share in the next two fiscal years. Multiplying those figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Microsoft's 35 and Apple's 28) yields a stock price of $546 for Microsoft and $218 for Apple.
Looking at their current positions, these projections would see Microsoft's stock rise by 35% and Apple's increase by 20% by fiscal 2026. If these projections are correct, Microsoft has significantly more room to run and is the better tech stock to buy this month.

Better Tech Stock: Microsoft vs. Apple was originally published by The Motley Fool","With the European Commission set to rule on Spotify’s complaint focused on competition in the streaming music market, there are hints that the ruling will not be in Apple’s favor. This week, the Financial Times reported the EC will issue its first-ever fine against the tech giant for allegedly breaking EU law over competition in the streaming music market. The fine is expected to be around €500 million (about $539 million USD), the report noted.
Instead of chalking up the fine as the cost of doing business, as a company that made history as the first to be valued at $3 trillion surely could, the tech giant is taking the fight to the public.
In a statement shared with media today, Apple argued against the idea that Spotify has been harmed by any anticompetitive practices on its part. (The statement was not issued by a single spokesperson, but rather comes from Apple itself). It reads:
We’re happy to support the success of all developers — including Spotify, which is the largest music streaming app in the world. Spotify pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped them build, update, and share their app with Apple users in 160 countries spanning the globe. Fundamentally, their complaint is about trying to get limitless access to all of Apple’s tools without paying anything for the value Apple provides.
Apple pointed out also that Spotify has a 56% share of the market, compared with 20% for Amazon Music and Apple Music’s 11%, per MIDiA’s 2022 report on the subscription music market.
In addition, Apple shared a number of non-public details about Spotify’s business, as it pertains to Apple’s platforms, including, for example, that Spotify uses thousands of Apple’s APIs across 60 frameworks; that Spotify uses Apple’s beta testing platform TestFlight; that Spotify has submitted over 420 versions of its app to App Review, which were approved; and even that Apple engineers have helped Spotify solve various challenges, like those impacting hardware-accelerated media playback and battery optimization.
And, for those number watchers out there, Apple also said that Spotify’s app had been downloaded, re-downloaded or updated more than 119 billion times across Apple devices — a stat we had not heard before, we should note.
The fact that Apple is front-running the EC’s decision with its own commentary is remarkable, in and of itself.
It speaks to a company that so solidly believes that it’s doing the best thing for its own customers and developer partners that any sort of ruling that deems otherwise is so absurd that it demands comment and pushback. Apple believes its system of in-app purchases for things like music subscriptions saves consumers not only the headache and inconvenience of having to visit external websites on the iPhone’s small screen — they can just click the side button instead — but also protects against fraud, excess data collection, consumer confusion over cancellations and errant purchases by children. (Of course, Apple is familiar with the latter itself.)
Apple believes that Spotify only wants to increase its profits, by leveraging regulations to its advantage. In the case of the EU complaint, the concern is that Apple’s App Store distorts competition in the music streaming market. It is not solely a complaint that Spotify has been harmed, in other words, but that the nature of the App Store may have thwarted other rivals.
“Spotify is a big player in the music streaming market but we don’t know what would have been the conditions without this,” EVP and competition chief Margrethe Vestager said about the EC’s investigation back in 2021. “There are other rivals to Apple Music — there are Deezer, there are Soundcloud. Smaller competitors and here we have real concerns about their developments. This is not a Spotify case — this is a music streaming case,” she noted.
Spotify, however, has been the loudest of the Apple Music rivals and has fought against the company on other matters, for instance by calling Apple’s new DMA rules “extortion” and a “complete and total farce.”
To protect its interests (and, Apple argues, consumers), Apple’s response to the EU’s DMA (Digital Markets Act) regulation is the introduction of a new system that requires developers to pay for its services beyond just App Store payment processing. Rather, it now separates payment processing from other services by levying a “Core Technology Fee” for those developers who want to do business under the new DMA rules. In other words, it wants developers to pay Apple for the work it does to create and maintain its iOS platform, where apps can run, rather than acknowledging that access to consumers’ favorite apps helps sell its iPhones.
For the record, Apple disputes Spotify’s claims that it’s been harmed by any anticompetitive practices. It speaks to the success Spotify has seen over the years, having grown its streaming app over eight years from 25 million to 160 million subscribers — a 27% average growth rate. It points out that Spotify users regularly subscribe to the service outside its app, and that Spotify qualifies for the “Reader app” exception to Apple’s rules, which allows it to link directly to its website for account creation and payment, similar to Netflix.
However, Apple seems to ignore the fact that Spotify turning a quarterly profit still makes headlines, that it just laid off 17% of its workforce, and that, you know, Spotify does face competition on iOS globally from Apple Music, which is preinstalled on iPhones, iPads and other Apple devices. In addition to being offered as a standalone service, Apple’s music streaming app is upsold to customers as part of the Apple One bundles, which combine multiple Apple services, like iCloud+, News+, Apple TV+ and others, under one roof.
Apple also stresses how closely Spotify has worked with the Commission on its complaint, having met with the regulators more than 65 times since the investigation began. The investigation, however, has been ongoing for years.
A rep for the EC declined to comment on news related to Spotify’s complaint or any pending fines. The FT had reported the fine is expected to be announced early next month.
Spotify responded to Apple’s statement with one of its own, saying:
Spotify’s success has happened despite Apple’s best efforts to gain an artificial advantage by favoring their own music service at every turn while placing roadblocks and imposing unfair restrictions on ours. Under their current rules Apple controls Spotify’s access to its own customers and gives Spotify one of two untenable options: We either have to deliver a poor user experience where we can’t directly communicate how to buy or subscribe to Spotify on iPhones or we have to accept a 30% cost disadvantage against our biggest competitor. This is not a level playing field. We support the European Commission and trust that they will take action soon to create a fair ecosystem for everyone involved.
Additional reporting: Natasha Lomas; Updated 2/22/24 5:54 PM with Spotify statement.","Reaching a $1 trillion valuation is one of the most prestigious milestones a company can achieve, and it usually takes decades of consistent operational excellence. That's why a mere six U.S. companies have valuations of $1 trillion or more right now:
- Microsoft
- Apple
- Nvidia (NVDA 0.35%)
- Alphabet (Google parent)
- Amazon
- Meta Platforms
However, Apple and Microsoft are the only two companies to have valuations north of $2 trillion at the moment. In fact, they were each worth more than $3 trillion before a recent sell-off in their stock.
One more company looks almost certain to join them and stay there. On Friday, within the first hour of the market opening, Nvidia crossed the $2 trillion mark but closed the day back under the major milestone. It is worth $1.97 trillion as of this writing, and $1 trillion of that value was created in the last 12 months alone. Following another spectacular set of financial results released this month, Nvidia is now charging toward a $2 trillion market cap. Here's why it's likely to get there -- and stay there -- this year.
Nvidia has a rich history of innovation
Nvidia was founded in 1993 with a goal to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia industries. It released the world's first graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999, which marked the birth of its GeForce brand, and it remains the dominant name in gaming today.
But GPUs are now transforming the data center. A GPU features hundreds of cores, which means it can process high volumes of data much faster than a traditional central processing unit (CPU) and makes it ideal for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Nvidia designed its H100 GPU for that specific purpose, and it has been almost single-handedly responsible for the company's incredible growth over the past year.
While the H100 is already the first choice for most AI data center operators, Nvidia's innovation engine has been hard at work developing the next iteration. It's called the H200, and it's twice as fast as the H100 when it comes to inferencing, which involves feeding an AI model live data so it can make predictions. It also consumes half the energy, making it far cheaper for data center operators to run. Shipments of the H200 will ramp up this year, and Nvidia already says there is no way it will keep up with demand.
Nvidia isn't just an AI hardware provider
Much of Nvidia's success can be attributed to its software ecosystem, which is increasingly important. Its CUDA platform allows developers to optimize their GPUs so they can develop applications much faster. But here's the kicker -- CUDA can't be used with chips from other manufacturers, so developers who are comfortable with CUDA have to stick with Nvidia's GPUs. That's why it will be so difficult for competitors to unseat Nvidia's dominance.
But that's not all. CEO Jensen Huang says Nvidia's engineers now manage, optimize, patch, and tune the AI software stack for businesses through its AI Enterprise platform. It's effectively an artificial intelligence operating system that offers development tools and pre-trained models to help businesses accelerate the creation of AI applications.
Nvidia AI Enterprise is accessible through major cloud platforms like Amazon Web services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, which effectively serve as distribution channels and give Nvidia access to millions of potential customers.
Huang believes every enterprise in the world deploying software will eventually use Nvidia AI Enterprise. It was only launched in 2021 -- before AI really took off -- yet it has already amassed $1 billion in annual revenue.
Nvidia's revenue growth is skyrocketing thanks to AI
Nvidia just reported its financial results for fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28). Its revenue surged to $60.9 billion, which was up 126% compared to fiscal 2023, and as the below chart shows, it has increased more than tenfold in just the last eight years.
The data center was the main driver of Nvidia's spectacular fiscal year, thanks to AI and the H100 GPU. The data center segment was responsible for $47.5 billion (78%) of the company's total revenue, and it marked an increase of 217% from fiscal 2023.
The company expects to carry its momentum into the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Its forecast points to $24 billion in total revenue, which will represent 233% growth compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. However, investors should really focus on the long term because Nvidia believes the generative AI revolution is only getting started.
Jensen Huang believes accelerated computing and generative AI will lead to a doubling of the current installed base of world data center infrastructure, which is an opportunity he says will be worth hundreds of billions of dollars in just the next five years.
Nvidia is a stone's throw away from the $2 trillion club
As I touched on at the top, Nvidia is currently worth $1.97 trillion. It already leapfrogged tech giants like Amazon and Alphabet in terms of valuation, and if its stock gains just another 1.5%, it will join Apple and Microsoft in the $2 trillion club.
Based on Nvidia's $12.96 in non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share (profit) in fiscal 2024 and its current stock price of $788.17, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 60.6. That's almost twice the 32.1 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index, which implies Nvidia is extremely expensive. However, the stock market is a forward-looking machine.
Wall Street is already forecasting $20.44 in earnings for Nvidia in fiscal 2025, which would reduce its P/E ratio to 37.9 (assuming its stock price remained the same). While that is still more expensive than the Nasdaq-100, a company growing as quickly as Nvidia deserves a premium. There might even be significant upside to come.
A Wall Street analyst from Loop Capital believes Nvidia stock could jump 53% to $1,200. That would take Nvidia's valuation to almost $3 trillion! That target is a little ambitious -- if not unrealistic -- in the short term, but if Jensen Huang is right about the data center opportunity in the next five years, the stock could certainly get there in the longer term.
In any case, Nvidia's entry into the $2 trillion club now appears to be a foregone conclusion.","Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has yet to seriously lean into the AI opportunity but it feels like it is only a matter of time until it makes some serious AI-flavored moves. During the tech giant’s recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook showed excitement about AI and indicated that Apple would be unveiling AI-related developments later this year.
Since AI has already been integrated into smartphones for several years, powering features such as facial recognition, translation, and image editing, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi suggests that actually defining what constitutes an AI phone is “somewhat messy.” However, he believes the term should probably be applied to smartphones that are specifically marketed by OEMs as “AI phones.” Some big names are already doing just that, the most notable AI offerings being Google’s Pixel 8/Pixel 8 Pro, and Samsung’s Galaxy S24 series.
Rather than being all-out revolutionary, these models’ AI capabilities “appear incremental.” Furthermore, both offerings have seen minimal hardware changes compared to their previous models, primarily focusing on upgrades to processors and batteries, which are standard features in new smartphone models.
So, what could Apple do? Sacconaghi thinks the company could focus on enhancing AI capabilities that align closely with its existing products while introducing incremental improvements. This could include advancements in image and video capture/editing tools, bolstered translation and transcription features, improved messaging support, enhanced Siri functionality, and increased automation in services like Apple Music. Additionally, Apple may look to provide a more seamless user experience, aiming to enhance overall ease of use across its ecosystem.
Within this context, Sacconaghi thinks that there are two important questions to consider: “1) Even if Apple’s AI functionality is not unique, will the novelty of AI + Apple’s powerful marketing be enough to trigger a material upgrade cycle, especially since Apple appears ‘due’ for a strong cycle following a weak iPhone 14 and 15? We note that Apple was late relative to peers to introduce large screens (6/6+ cycle), OLED (iPhone X) and 5G, but each triggered meaningful upgrade cycles for Apple; (2) how much of the new AI capability will be exclusive to iPhone 16 vs. be a software upgrade to Apple’s installed base? We believe more the former, which points to bigger announcements in Sept with iPhone’s launch than in June (WWDC).”
For now, Sacconaghi remains on the sidelines with a Market-Perform (i.e., Neutral) rating on Apple shares, and a $195 price target, suggesting the shares will post growth of 6% over the coming months. (To watch Sacconaghi’s track record, click here)
7 other analysts join Sacconaghi on the fence, and with 1 additional Sell and 16 Buys, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $206.15, the average target makes room for one-year returns of ~12%. (See Apple stock forecast)

It is very important to do your own analysis before making any investment.",,,,"As I sit here writing this in the Apple Vision Pro, I’m acutely aware of how the light seal presses against my forehead and cheekbones. It was relatively comfy when I slipped it on an hour ago. But now, every so often, I push up on the bridge — as if I’m a cartoon nerd saying, um, well, actually — just to give my face a break. This is despite the fact that I’ve done the scan to figure out my perfect light seal fit (33W, in case you’re wondering). So no, I’m not surprised that many Apple fans who returned their Vision Pros cited comfort as a major issue.
But this isn’t exclusively a Vision Pro problem. It’s a wearable problem.
I say this a lot in my reviews, but comfort is king. For other gadget categories, comfort is mostly a question of weight. With wearables, fit adds another layer of complexity. You’re not going to wear a smartwatch, smart ring, smart glasses, or a mixed reality headset if you don’t find it comfortable. The catch is that it’s hard to scale a comfy fit for the mass market. Even if a company tries its damnedest, somebody always gets left out.
Smartwatches often come in multiple sizes: 40–42mm for smaller wrists, 44–47mm for medium-size wrists, and 48–50mm for larger wrists. Problem solved, right? Not quite. Smaller size smartwatches often get shafted due to technical constraints. They have worse battery life compared to bigger watches, which can cram in beefier batteries. The biggest watches also tend to get the newest features first. (See: Garmin Fenix 6X and solar charging, Apple Watch Ultra and dual-frequency GPS, etc.) As a petite-wristed person, I always have to choose whether I want features and battery life or comfort. Either way, I have to give up something.
The average ring size for women is a 6, and for men, it’s a 9 or 10. In the US and Canada, regular rings can come in sizes ranging from 3 to 16. Half sizes are also an option. With smart rings, few, if any, are available for people with ring sizes below 6 or above 13. Smart ring makers like Oura, Movano, Ultrahuman, and Circular also don’t support half sizes. It’s understandable. Smart rings have technical components stuffed inside them. That makes them impossible to resize, and it makes financial sense for companies to only mass-produce the most common sizes. But it means you only get 7 or 8 size options with smart rings, compared to roughly 28 with regular rings.
Every time I review smart glasses, I get people in my DMs asking about how they fit. For those of us without aquiline noses, glasses without proper nose pads will constantly slip off your face. That happened to me when I reviewed the Amazon Echo Frames Carrera Cruiser. It gets old real fast. I’m sure Amazon has its reasons for only offering a standard fit, but low nose bridges are quite common. It’s leaving out a large swath of people globally.
The root issue is that every human body is different. You could argue that companies should try to provide a bespoke fitting experience for the best results. However, that can be a logistical nightmare, too. To get a pair of the now-defunct Focals by North, I had to physically go to their store in Brooklyn and get my face 3D scanned. At launch, online scans weren’t an option. After, I had to return three weeks later for a fitting with the actual product. Those smart glasses fit me the best, but for most people, in-person fittings weren’t feasible unless they lived near the company’s Toronto or New York City stores. By the time Focals by North rolled out app-based fittings, the writing was on the wall for the company.
I don’t have a solution. I think the best any wearable maker can do is prioritize comfort and make devices easier to wear with each generation. Those that don’t, do so at their own peril. It doesn’t have to be a category-sweeping innovation, either. The Evie Ring added an open gap up top that makes it easy to take off when your fingers swell. It’s small but dramatically improved wearability. If done well, prioritizing comfort has the added benefit of minimizing how many people are left out.
With the Vision Pro, Apple did a reasonably good job of accommodating as many face shapes as it could. But if it truly wants spatial computing to be a thing, it needs to brainstorm ways to make it comfortable enough for the vast majority of people to wear for several hours at a time. Some people are lucky because that’s already their experience. For me, the headset is relatively comfortable. Today, that wasn’t enough. I only made it two-thirds of the way through this article before I had to take it off.","Tom's Guide Verdict

“What the heck is happening?” That’s what I said to myself as I played virtual DJ, spinning two records in front of me with a cross-fade knob and special effects I could control with my hands in mid-air. I just reached out and touched them.
I had a similar WTF moment — in a good way — when I just looked at my MacBook to connect and supersize its display on the wall in front of me. Then I pinned the Apple Music app to the left of my desk and Slack to the right. This is what Apple means by spatial computing.
And I was left almost speechless when I viewed a 3D spatial video of my three dogs coming towards the camera. It’s so immersive you may get a bit emotional. Oh, and you can watch regular 3D movies in Apple TV+ that blow away your local theater.

The Apple Vision Pro is an incredible piece of technology, with eye and hand tracking interface that puts the competition to shame. But there’s some early bugs and some very weird things that come along with this revolution, including a freaky digital Persona version of yourself that can appear in FaceTime calls.
Starting at $3,500, the Vision Pro is obscenely expensive and for well-heeled early adopters only. But it is the most innovative product Apple has created in over a decade and a fascinating look at the future of computing and entertainment rolled into one very sleek package. Here’s what it’s like to use and my pros and cons so far.
Apple Vision Pro review cheat sheet
- What is it? A spatial computing headset that combines augmented reality experiences and virtual reality

Apple Vision Pro review: Release date, price and accessories
The Apple Vision Pro is available for pre-order now and the release date is February 2.
This headset may be able to track your eyes with amazing precision, but it also starts at an eye-watering price of $3,499. The entry-level model comes with 256GB of storage, and it’s $3,699 for 512GB and $3,899 for 1TB.
Wear glasses? The ZEISS optical inserts for readers cost $99 and prescription lenses cost $149, though I do like how easily they magnetically attach to the Vision Pro. Apple Care+ will run you an additional $499, which gives you 2 years of unlimited repairs and damage protection.
In terms of accessories, there’s plenty of options, but the one I recommend most is the $199 travel case, which is big and bulky but will protect the Vision Pro when you’re flying or just going to and from the office. Other accessories include Belkin’s battery holder for $49.

Apple Vision Pro review: What’s in the box?
The Apple Vision Pro comes in a pretty big box, and there’s lots of stuff in it, including the headset itself, the Light Seal fitted for your face, the Light Seal Cushion and both the Solo Knit Band and Dual Loop Band.
There’s also the Apple Vision Pro battery, which remains tethered to the headset at all time, a second thicker Light Seal Cushion, a polishing cloth and a 30W USB-C power adapter.
Apple Vision Pro review: Design and comfort
The Apple Vision Pro is easily the sleekest headset yet, with a curved glass front panel and a modular design that makes it very customizable to the wearer. But it’s definitely not light. After 30 minutes I felt it weighing on my cheeks.
When ordering your Vision Pro, you’ll scan your face (similar to how you’d set up Face ID) to get a Light Seal that’s personalized, which prevents light from leaking into your view.
There are two bands that come with the Vision Pro. There’s the Solo Knit Band and the Dual Loop band. The former is stretchy and makes it really easy to take the Vision Pro on and off, and you can quickly tighten and loosen the fit with the built-in knob.
The Dual Loop Band provides more stability because there’s a strap that goes across the top of your head and the back. I find this one better for longer Vision Pro sessions as there’s more support for what’s a pretty weighty headset.
The Vision Pro weighs 1.3 to 1.4 pounds (depending on the Light Seal and head band configuration), which is more than an 11-inch iPad Pro on your head. For context, the Meta Quest 3 weighs 1.1 pounds and the Meta Quest Pro 1.6 pounds.
After wearing the Vision Pro on and off for several hours, I didn’t find it uncomfortable to wear, but I did feel like taking periodic breaks because of the heft. I also got some light red marks on my cheeks.
The right side of the Vision Pro houses the digital crown, which brings up the home screen from wherever you are. Turning the crown dials up the immersion on whatever Environment you’re watching (more on that later) and also controls the volume. The button on the left side of the headset is a top button, which you can use for capturing spatial photos and videos, as well as confirming purchases.
I really like how modular the Vision Pro design is. The Light Seal and and Light Seal Cushion attach magnetically to the device, and it’s easy to swap out the two band options by pulling on little orange tags. But I’d say the magnetic connection could be a bit stronger; a couple times when picking up the Vision Pro, the Light Seal detached. So you’re better off holding it by the metal and glass frame.
Apple Vision Pro review: Interface, hand and eye tracking
The Apple Vision Pro feels revolutionary because of how easy it is to operate. There’s no controllers to deal with. You just use your eyes to look at the element you want to select and then tap your thumb and index finger together to “click.”
While setting up the Vision Pro I immediately got accustomed to the input because you’re walked through a calibration process that involves following a dot around the screen and selecting it. Then you’re greeted with a home screen of iOS-like icons that float in front of your view of the room you’re in.
Vision OS starts with your real-world view as the baseline because the Vision Pro wants to bring digital content to your environment instead of taking it over. And the video pass-through is very life-like, as the dedicated R1 chip is fast enough to stream images to the Vision Pro’s microOLED displays within 12 milliseconds — that’s 8x faster than you blink.
I had no problem walking from room to room or using my iPhone with the Vision Pro on, though the frame rate of my iPhone 14 Pro Max was a tad sluggish.
As you stare around the home screen view and move your eyes from icon to icon, they light up ready to be selected. This is immensely satisfying, relaxing and easy to do, because the Vision Pro has downward-facing cameras that can track your hands in your lap.
The eye tracking is so good it’s also used to authenticate you via OpticID, which measures your pupils for security. So think Face ID for your eyes. When it works, it works well, but a couple of times during my testing it didn’t work, and sometimes you need to enter your PIN code via a floating keypad to enable OpticID, which I found annoying.
So what about gestures? You can easily scroll from left to right and up to down by pinching your fingers together and drag the direction you want to move. Zooming in on a photo or webpage is as easy as pinching your fingers together with both hands and spreading them apart. It’s Minority Report-cool.
In case you're wondering, I tried the Vision Pro in complete darkness, and you'll get warning that says you won't see your hands. But the hand- and eye-tracking interface still works, so you can definitely watch movies in bed.
Apple Vision Pro review: Spatial computing and work
So what can you do with the Vision Pro? For starters, it’s a multitasking champ, thanks to the built-in M2 chip that runs the OS. For example, I launched Safari in the center of my space, then I turned to my left and asked Siri to launch Slack and the app appeared. Then I turned to the right of Safari and opened Apple Music so I could have that playing in the background.
Even better, it’s easy to move apps around in your virtual space by selecting the bar beneath the app, and you can resize them by staring at the bottom right corner and dragging it with your finger. If you want to close an app, you can either stare at the X beneath the window or simply ask Siri to close all apps. You can also go back home at any time by long pressing the digital crown.
At any time you can pull up the Control Center by simply looking up and clicking on the floating downward-facing arrow. From this menu you can change Environments, turn on Guest mode, access Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, start screen recording and more.
One of the options in Control Center is the ability to connect with your Mac, but you can also bring your Mac desktop into the Vision Pro just by looking at it. I saw a Connect button floating above my MacBook Pro 14-inch, pinched my fingers together and saw my laptop’s screen go blank, popping up on the wall in front of me instead.
You don’t get multiple desktop views, but you do get a crystal clear 4K display that renders text crisply, and you can make that canvas positively huge so it dwarfs most of the best monitors. Your keyboard and mouse still work as they normally would with no latency. You can even use your keyboard in Vision Pro apps if you want. Yes, only Apple could do this, and I could see myself taking the Vision Pro on business trips and using it back at the hotel.
Apple Vision Pro review: Environments
One of the unique aspects of the Apple Vision Pro is your choice of multiple Environments. Think of them as 3D desktops on steroids. There are several options available, ranging from Yosemite and Haleakalā to the Moon.
I pulled up Mount Hood and was floored by the level of realism, with detailed sand and rocks beneath my feet, rippling water in front of me and a towering mountain in the background. And you get to decide how immersive the Environment is by turning the digital crown clockwise (more) or counterclockwise (less).
There are also Environments that are unique to specific apps. For instance, Apple TV+ has its own cinema Environment for watching movies that makes it feel like you’re watching a 100-foot screen, while Disney+ lets you use The Avengers Tower as your backdrop — complete with a collection of Iron Man suits — before playing a show or movie.
Apple Vision Pro review: Typing and voice input
The Apple Vision Pro lets you type on a floating keyboard to enter text, but it’s not very satisfying. For one, there’s no tactile feedback, even though you hear clicks as you type. And you can’t type very quickly; it’s more a peck-peck-peck scenario with one or two hands.
I do like that you can enter text with your voice. For example, if you’re in Safari and you just stare at the microphone icon in the address bar and speak “tomsguide.com” it will automatically take you to that website.
Also keep in mind that you can easily pair a Bluetooth keyboard to the Apple Vision Pro for easier and faster text input.
Apple Vision Pro review: 3D movies, Immersive Video and audio
The Apple Vision Pro on day one is already a first-class entertainment device, and it will make even the biggest skeptic a believer in 3D movies.
There are hundreds of 3D movies available in Apple TV+, and I couldn’t believe how good “Man of Steel” looked through the Vision Pro. As Superman took off for the first time, it was like he flew right over my shoulder.
The more recent “The Super Mario Bros.” movie was even more immersive, with the characters popping off the screen as Mario flew around in his raccoon suit while being chased by an oversized bomb.
This is a good time to mention that the sound from the Apple Vision Pro is surprisingly good. There are two audio pods built into the strap positioned close to your ears, and they deliver rich and balanced Spatial Audio. For example, I could hear Mario coming from the left side of the screen and Princess Peach from the right as they spoke.
When listening to SZA’s “Kill Bill” through Apple Music, the audio pods had plenty of punch in the drums and the vocals were crystal clear. However, it’s worth noting that the audio will leak out from the Vision Pro when listening so if you want to keep things private you should wear AirPods. The AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C is your best bet because they support lossless audio.
If you want to take entertainment to the next level, there’s Immersive Video, a new format that delivers a 3D experience via 8K recordings with a 180-degree field of view. For example, I nearly lost my breath when I watched a female highliner attempt to essentially walk a tightrope between two mountains 3,000 feet above the Earth in Norway.
As she narrated her thought process, I was mesmerized by the surrounding landscape, veins popping out of her feet as she walked barefoot across the chasm and the intensity in her blue eyes. In another Immersive Video starring Alicia Keys, I felt like I was right in the studio with her as she rehearsed, and I could see her backup singers as I peered over to the right and the instruments and speakers on the left.
Apple has shown other examples of how Immersive Video could come to life, such as through a goalie’s perspective during a soccer match, and I could see this as a game changing format for watching sporting events, especially since Apple has rights to broadcast MLB and MLS games. You could essentially sit anywhere you want to see the action.
Apple Vision Pro review: Photos and Spatial Video
One of the biggest selling points of the Apple Vision Pro is spatial photos and videos. You can take 3D stills and videos using the headset itself or capture spatial videos with the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max (not photos).
I took a spatial video of my three dogs at home in our sunroom and each pup looked incredibly life-like as they got closer to the camera and my golden retriever showed me his Christmas stocking chew toy. You’ll get the best results if your subjects are moving and you stay fairly still, as I lost the immersive effect when I turned my head to follow them around.
To take a spatial video with the Vision Pro, you use the top button on the left side of the headset, but I felt pretty geeky while doing it. You will be made fun of by family and friends — guaranteed.
The Vision Pro also brings panoramic photos to life in a new way by wrapping them around you. So it’s as if you’re standing in the center of the frame. For example, I took a panorama of the Manhattan skyline from the balcony of a Bronx apartment building, and I was completely immersed in the photo, from the Coca-Cola truck on the left side of the frame to the bridge in the center and the tall skyscrapers peaking through the cloudy background.
If you own a Vision Pro, you’ll be inspired to take more panoramic photos. But even regular photos take on new life in the Vision Pro as you scroll through your gallery. I had a blast reliving pics I took on a trip with my son to see the Buffalo Bills game and Niagara falls. His smile at the game is priceless when I see it this big.
Apple Vision Pro review: Apps
The Apple Vision Pro can run over a million compatible iPhone and iPad apps at launch, which is nice, but I was more interested in testing the truly native Vision Pro apps. While the selection is fairly modest for now — Apple says there's 600 native Vision Pro apps so far — some of the experiences are mind-blowing. Other Vision Pro apps seem more like tech demos than full-blown apps.
The most impressive Vision Pro app I tried is djay, which puts you right in front of a mixer and turntables. I had no idea what I was doing but was still blown away with the realism of the table itself and the fact that I could interact with all the buttons, sliders and needles as if they were there. And there’s wild transparent boxes that you can put your hand through to make special effects. This is nuts.
SkyGuide is a very immersive app that puts you inside a planetarium wherever you are. As you look up at the night sky you can make out constellations and also use a laser pointer to draw in the sky. This is an app that made my teenage son go “woah,” so you know it’s good.
Other notable Vision Pro apps I tried include JigSpace, which lets you place 3D animations and models right in front of you, from an airplane engine to a Formula One race car, complete with realistic light reflections. And Voyager by ForeFlight makes you feel like an air traffic controller as you watch real-time 3D visuals of planes taking off and landing at various airports. Other apps were less impressive, such as Carrot Weather.
While it’s a short experience, the Encounter Dinosaurs app from Apple is a heart-stopping example of what’s possible with the Vision Pro. A butterfly literally flies and lands on top of your finger before a giant dinosaur enters the frame, sees that you’re looking at it and then jumps out of the screen so that his nose is inches from your face. It’s scary and thrilling.
It’s very noteworthy what apps are not here at launch for the Vision Pro, such as Netflix and YouTube. There’s not even iPad-compatible apps right now. When asked about snubbing the Vision Pro, Netflix’s CEO said that they’re in discussions with Apple but right now the device is “so subscale that it’s not particularly relevant.” Yikes.
Other developers are stepping up with impressive apps, though. TikTok is a streamlined, simple and very immersive app. There's a video player front and center and you can easily pull up comments, though I'd like to see spatial video support added.
For more info, check out my roundups of the best Apple Vision Pro apps so far.
Apple Vision Pro review: Games
Does the Vision Pro have killer games? Not that I can see, but there’s a pretty good mix of native games you can control with your hands and iPad apps you can supersize and play with a controller. Jetpack Joyride is easy to control. You just press your fingers together to boost the jetpack and move your hand to fly the character.
Synthriders is way more ambitious, which is also available on Meta Quest. You use your hands to touch colorful floating balls and beams of light coming at you to the beat of a song, and you can also dodge and duck obstacles. It’s a fantastic example of mixed reality done right.
I also played What the Golf?, which is a casual mini golf game where you can place the virtual course anywhere in the room and start putting. To hit the ball you put your fingers around it and pull back and you’ll see an arrow that you can then direct with your hand. Let it go and you’ll see your ball head towards the pin. Trying to select the ball didn’t always work the first time, but I loved that I could walk around the course to get a different vantage point and the view never stuttered.
In addition, I tried a few iPad games with a connected controller on the Vision Pro, such as SonicDreamTeam. The action and graphics were smooth, but it’s essentially a 2D experience on a very large screen. You can also play Mac games through the Vision Pro, such as Resident Evil Village — if you have a powerful enough MacBook.
Personally, I’d like to see more native Vision Pro games that take advantage of your hands, such as fighting games and first-person shooters. For example, the Meta Quest 3 has a great sword fighting game called Broken Edge. Gaming is one area where Apple needs to catch up.
Apple Vision Pro review: EyeSight and Persona
Apple doesn’t want people to be closed off from the rest of the world while using the Vision Pro, so they’ve developed a few technologies to keep you at least somewhat connected.
The first innovation is EyeSight, which allows others to see a digital version of your eyes when they try to engage you while you’re wearing Vision Pro. So while you’re watching content and they walk into the room they might see a shimmer of light on the front display, but as they get closer and start to chat with you you’ll see the person break through into your view and they’ll see your eyes. It’s a subtle effect and a bit creepy looking, but it’s effective. Still, there’s no substitute for, you know, briefly taking off the headset.
The much more controversial feature is Persona, which is in beta and on the surface feels very metavers-y and un-Apple. But it started to grow on me (a little) once I started making FaceTime calls with it.
Persona is a 3D avatar of you that you create by scanning your face with the front cameras of the Vision Pro. You’ll be guided through the process step by step, which includes holding the headset in front of you, turning your face side to side and up and down, as well as smiling, raising your eyebrows and closing your eyes.
From there, the Vision Pro builds your Persona in less than a minute, and the result is impressive from a technical standpoint but also quite Uncanny Valley and conjures images of Madden or NBA 2K. It’s like me, but not quite me.
Also, I like to think I’m not too vain, but the Vision Pro managed to amplify the wrinkles on my forehead. In fact, my wife said my Persona looked like I was put through an aging filter. The good news is that if you don’t like how you look you can always recapture your Persona. You can also tweak your Persona by adjusting the color tone of your skin and the brightness, and you can choose from multiple Portrait-like effects. Contour, for example, is the most flattering.
You can also accessorize your Persona using digital glasses, but that’s about it. You can’t add things like jewelry or different clothes, etc. I’d like to see more customization options. And I wouldn't' mind if Apple took longer to process your Persona and also scanned (with your permission) some of your selfies to get the best possible result.
As part of visionOS 1.1, Apple is offering appearance updates for the Persona, so you should look a little more like yourself.
Once in a video call, you can share your Vision Pro view and any apps you’re working in, which is great for collaboration. So Apple deserves kudos for that.
Apple Vision Pro review: Performance
The Apple Vision Pro packs plenty of power between its M2 chip for overall performance and the R1 chip for processing input from the camera, sensors and microphones. Overall, I found the Vision Pro to be quite responsive and fluid, whether I was pinning multiple apps in my space, watching 3D movies or playing intense games. The Vision Pro also remained cool to the touch.
However, I did encounter some bugs at times with the Vision Pro. For example, during one session the headset refused to open the Photos app I was staring at and clicking on. Taking the headset off and putting it back on fixed the problem.
On another occasion Siri refused to open some apps like Slack and Apple Music while opening others. It wasn’t a consistent issue but was still annoying. During another session the Vision Pro wouldn’t accept my OpticID to sign in, though I do like the headset will guide you to place it further down on your head if you’re off center.
Apple Vision Pro review: Battery
The aluminum battery on the Vision Pro always needs to be with you to use the headset, which is not great. So you’ll need to put it in your pocket while standing or next to you while sitting. It’s 12.4 ounces, which is heavier than an iPhone 15 Pro Max (7.8 ounces). And while the cord is long enough most of the time, if you’re really immersed in a game or other experience and you move suddenly you could accidentally tug the battery off a table or couch onto the floor.
I’m also not a fan of how the cord to the battery can sometimes get a bit tangled. A couple of times I had to disconnect the cable so it would straighten out.
As for endurance, the Vision Pro’s battery is rated for 2 hours of general use and 2.5 hours of video playback. In my testing of on and off use over 2 hours, the Vision Pro was down to about 60% and then down to 40% after another couple hours.
If you want to use the Vision Pro continuously, you can always just plug in the battery using the included USB-C power adapter. Competing mixed reality headsets like the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest Pro have batteries built into the headset, which is more convenient, but they’re also less powerful.
Apple Vision Pro review updates
- Feb 7: The Apple Vision Pro visionOS 1.1 beta brings ""appearance updates"" to your Persona, as well as the ability to reset the Vision Pro on the device itself instead of needing to send it back to Apple.
- Feb 6: An Apple Vision Pro durability test by JerryRigEverything has found that the front panel is highly susceptible to scratches, so you'll want to make sure to use the cover and carrying case. In addition, YouTube says that a dedicated Vision Pro app is in development.
- Feb 21: The Apple Vision Pro now has a TikTok app, which we found impressive during our hands-on time.
Apple Vision Pro review: Verdict
The Apple Vision Pro is easy to scoff at because of its price. And I definitely can’t afford one at $3,500. But now that I’ve been wearing one and testing all its features, I would argue that it’s the most innovative Apple product since the original iPhone.
There’s an insane amount of ingenuity on display here, from the razor-sharp microOLED displays and the super-realistic video pass-through to the remarkably intuitive and fun interface that tracks your eyes and hands. I’m also very impressed with the spatial computing experience, as it takes multitasking to the next level, especially when you add a Mac to the mix.
In terms of entertainment, the 3D video experience on the Vision Pro is unmatched, and Immersive Video in particular has a ton of potential to change the way we view everything from concerts to sporting events. And the 3D goodness continues with moving spatial videos and photos that transform your memories into something hyper-real.
The Vision Pro app situation is clearly still in the early stages with some notable heavy hitters missing at launch. But the AR apps I tried are jaw-droppingly convincing and should hopefully spur more developers to hop on board.
So what’s not to like about the Vision Pro? The super expensive price is a big one, as it will greatly limit this headset’s initial appeal. Some may want to wait for the rumored lower-cost version on the horizon, but there’s no timetable for that. I also found the tethered battery to be annoying at times and the Personas while admirable are a bit unnerving to look at. So hopefully they look considerably better after the beta stage.
So my bottom line on the Vision Pro is that it’s definitely revolutionary, but it’s a revolution very much in progress.

Apple's iPhone revenue in India rose 42% YoY in 2023 to $8.7B, as per a Morgan Stanley note.
iPhone sales in India outshine the European Union
Driven by strong consumer demand for premium devices, iPhone revenue in India jumped 42% year-over-year to $8.7 billion last year.
iPhone shipments to India also grew 39% to 9.2 million units, making India the fifth-largest smartphone market for Apple. This makes India a larger iPhone market for Apple than individual European Union countries like Germany or France.
""India represented 4% of iPhone shipments and revenue in 2023, up from just 1% five years ago. This compares to a 20% share in China, which declined slightly year-over-year,"" the Morgan Stanley report stated.
Indian consumers crave more storage
Underpinning robust iPhone growth in India is rising consumer appetite for pricier, high-capacity devices. The average iPhone sold in India last year had around 260 GB of storage, a 26% increase from 2021. India's iPhone average selling price also rose 2% to $940. The iPhone 13, 14 series, and 15 were the top sellers, accounting for 86% of sales.
Old iPhone models drove maximum sales for Apple
Market research firm IDC's recent data reveals key insights into the models driving iPhone growth in India. The IDC report shows that the iPhone 13, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 15 accounted for a substantial 86% of total iPhone sales in India in 2023.
While Indian consumers are buying premium devices, Apple's strategy of also selling older generation models at reduced prices is working well. This has allowed Apple to capture a greater slice of the value-focused Indian smartphone market while driving up overall iPhone shipments.
As per IDC, by catering to various price tiers beyond just the latest flagships, Apple has struck the right chord with Indian buyers. This segment-based approach has been vital to Apple registering a 39% year-on-year growth in iPhone volumes in the country.
Big India bets paying off for Apple
With China's iPhone growth stagnating amidst supply issues and market saturation, India is rising up the ranks for Apple. Propelling this growth is the appetite for premium devices instead of the latest models. This allowed Apple to capitalise on consumer demand in a price-sensitive market like India.
""If India continues its trajectory while China stays flat, India could overtake China to become Apple's largest iPhone market by 2027,"" Morgan Stanley analysts project.
In recent years, Apple has been increasing its investments in India, including opening its first retail stores last year. Manufacturing of iPhones in India has also been steadily rising to meet demand.
Morgan Stanley forecasts that Apple's India revenue will touch $40 billion by 2032. For a company facing market saturation and supply chain constraints in China, the growth in India comes as a boon.
Last year, Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, expressed his optimism about India during an earnings call, saying, ""I'm even more bullish now, hopefully on the other side of it."" Then, earlier this month, in the earnings call of Q4 2023, where Apple registered record iPhone revenue for the quarter and an all-time record for services, Cook highlighted India's importance, stating, ""India reported strong double digits in revenue terms in the December quarter and hit a quarter revenue record.""
As the second-largest smartphone market globally, India offers Apple a 1.4 billion consumer base that is just starting to trade up to pricier devices. With continued focus on addressing local demand, Apple seems poised for long-term gains in the Indian market.
For now, all eyes are on India as it emerges as a critical growth engine for Apple's iconic iPhone even as sales decline in China. The iPhone maker’s early mover advantage and understanding of Indian consumer preferences have set the stage for Apple to potentially make India its biggest iPhone market within a few years.","Apple, Tesla downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls
The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.
Top 5 Upgrades:
Deutsche Bank upgraded Southwest (LUV) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $42, up from $28. The firm believes more moderate domestic available seat mile growth for 2024 will have positive implications for domestic unit revenue performance, and by extension, should translate into solid sales performance for the domestic-focused names. As such, Deutsche upgraded Alaska (ALK), JetBlue (JBLU), and Southwest to Buy from Hold. Meanwhile, Bernstein also upgraded Southwest to Market Perform from Underperform with a price target of $32, up from $26.
UBS upgraded US Foods (USFD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $64, up from $47. Following the company's Q4 results, UBS is becoming more bullish on US Foods based on expectations for further market share gains on the back of sales force investments and its differentiated tech platform as well as higher conviction that the company's EBITDA growth trajectory is sustainable. Piper Sandler also upgraded US Foods to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $59, up from $45.
B. Riley upgraded Brunswick (BC) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $108, up from $100. The firm upgrades the shares following positive indications from the Miami International Boat Show around underlying demand trends, market share upside, increased moves to boost operating margins, and overall 2024 guidance conservatism.
Wolfe Research upgraded Freshworks (FRSH) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $27 price target. The firm sees the combination of improving fundamentals, execution, and competitive dynamics supporting multi-year 20% revenue growth with expanding margins for the company.
Mizuho upgraded LivaNova (LIVN) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $70, up from $60. The company has a ""well-hedged path"" to either 20-plus annual earnings growth over the next three years or upside optionality based on outcome of the RECOVER trial by mid-year, the firm tells investors in a research note.
Top 5 Downgrades:
Phillip Securities downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Neutral from Accumulate with an unchanged price target of $194. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade following the stock's recent gains, but says it expects Services to continue being Apple's main growth driver as its installed base increases.
Phillip Securities downgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Neutral from Accumulate with a $175 price target. The near-term outlook for Tesla ""looks quite bleak, with the company set on sacrificing margins and growth also slowing,"" the firm tells investors in a research note.
Phillip Securities downgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Neutral from Buy with a $150 price target, down from $157. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade following the recent rally and a slowdown in booking volumes for the downgrade.
Evercore ISI downgraded Caterpillar (CAT) to In Line from Outperform with a price target of $338, up from $321. The downgrade is not so much company specific as it is a call to take profits on the group, the firm tells investors in a research note.
Argus downgraded Johnson Controls (JCI) to Hold from Buy. The firm sees the stock's current valuations as reasonable given the company's reduced growth outlook due to the recent cybersecurity attack.
Top 5 Initiations:
Seaport Research initiated coverage of Booking Holdings (BKNG) with a Buy rating and $4,380 price target. The firm is positive on Booking's fundamentals saying the company is the clear leader in global online accommodations, with particular strength in Europe and Asia.
Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of BrightSpring Health (BTSG) with a Buy rating and $26 price target. The firm expects strong growth, emergence of medium-term upside drivers, acquisition execution and de-levering progress to be key drivers of the stock closing the valuation gap relative to peers. Jefferies, Wells Fargo, Leerink, BofA, UBS, and Morgan Stanley also started coverage of the name with Buy-equivalent ratings, while Deutsche Bank initiated the stock with a Hold.
Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of ArriVent Biopharma (AVBP) with a Buy rating and $27 price target. The firm anticipates clinical success of furmonertinib in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer. Citi and Jefferies also started coverage of the name with Buy-equivalent ratings.
UBS initiated coverage of Morgan Stanley Direct Lending (MSDL) with a Buy rating and $23.50 price target. Over the next 12-18 months, the firm expects the company to generate attractive returns and avoid significant credit issues, assuming the economy avoids a recession. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo started coverage of the name with Neutral-equivalent ratings, while RBC Capital initiated the stock with an Outperform.
JMP Securities initiated coverage of Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending (NCDL) with a Market Perform rating. The firm believes there could be an opportunity for valuation multiple expansion over time, but says this will likely take some time to play out, assuming strong execution. UBS and Wells Fargo also started coverage of the name with Neutral-equivalent ratings, while Truist and BofA started the stock with Buy.","According to the latest findings from the International Data Corporation (IDC), the tablet market in India experienced a notable downturn in 2023, with shipments totaling 4.01 million units, marking a 24.9% decline compared to the previous year.
The data reveals a mixed performance within the tablet categories, with detachables seeing a 17.7% year-on-year growth, while slates experienced a significant decline of 33.3% during the same period.
The consumer segment managed a modest 1.9% year-on-year growth, contrasting sharply with the commercial segment, which witnessed a steep 42.3% decline. This drop in the commercial sector was primarily attributed to the postponement or cancellation of several government deals. Additionally, the education segment saw a substantial decline of 53.7% year-on-year, while small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) experienced a 25.9% decrease in shipments.
In terms of market leadership, Samsung emerged on top with a commanding 39.5% market share, despite experiencing a 34.7% year-on-year decline. The company maintained its dominance in both the commercial and consumer segments, with shares of 46.6% and 33.4%, respectively.
Lenovo secured the second position with a 14.3% market share, though its shipments plummeted by 38.6% year-on-year. Apple followed closely behind in third place, holding a 13.9% market share despite an 11.1% year-on-year decline. Acer Group and Realme rounded out the top five with market shares of 7.3% and 6.8%, respectively.
“As newer Chinese vendors such as realme and Xiaomi became aggressive, consumers had more to choose from. With options under US$300, with bigger screens, and increased usage of tablets for on-the-go productivity and entertainment, the consumer segment grew despite challenging market conditions,” said Bharath Shenoy, senior research analyst, IDC India.
Navkendar Singh, associate vice president, Devices Research, IDC India, South Asia & ANZ said, “Tablets will be challenged in 2024 due to reduced demand in the commercial segment. Government-driven projects will be limited in the first half of 2024 due to the elections code of conduct. Also, tablets market will witness stiff competition from Chromebooks and entry level Android notebooks such as JioBook in the manifesto deals. With aggressive pricing, wider screens, keyboards, and 4G connectivity, the prospect of these entry-level notebooks in education deals looks positive.”","From Apple To BYJU's: CEOs Who Were Fired From Their Own Companies
Major shareholders of prominent edtech firm Byju’s, including Prosus NV and Peak XV Partners, voted on Friday to oust its founder, Byju Raveendran, from the position of chief executive officer. This move marks an escalation in the ongoing battle for control over the once high-flying online tutoring startup that is currently grappling to sustain its operations.
From BYJU's To Apple (Image Source: IANS)
Major shareholders of prominent edtech firm Byju’s, including Prosus NV and Peak XV Partners, voted on Friday to oust its founder, Byju Raveendran, from the position of chief executive officer. This move marks an escalation in the ongoing battle for control over the once high-flying online tutoring startup that is currently grappling to sustain its operations.
Byju’s swiftly responded by rejecting the resolutions, which not only aimed to remove Raveendran from the CEO role but also sought his removal from the board of the company he established in 2015. The founder's leadership and the company's strategic direction have become contentious issues among major stakeholders.
This development adds Byju’s to the list of companies that have witnessed CEO upheavals. In a similar line, OpenAI experienced a sudden leadership change as CEO Sam Altman was dismissed by the board on November 18, citing a loss of confidence in his leadership. Altman's return as CEO was announced on November 21 after an agreement was reached, introducing a new initial board.
Apple also faced a CEO departure in 1985 when co-founder Steve Jobs left due to conflicts with the board over his confrontational management style. Jobs made a triumphant return in 1997, steering Apple to significant success. In 2008, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey was removed as CEO, only to make a comeback in 2015, leading the platform for another six years before passing the baton to Parag Agrawal in 2021.

Apple to hold its Annual General Meeting on 28th of February
CEO Tim Cook's total compensation includes salary of US$3.00m
Total compensation is 458% above industry average
Apple's EPS grew by 21% over the past three years while total shareholder return over the past three years was 48%
Under the guidance of CEO Tim Cook, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has performed reasonably well recently. As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 28th of February, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum. However, some shareholders will still be cautious of paying the CEO excessively.
View our latest analysis for Apple
Comparing Apple Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The Industry
According to our data, Apple Inc. has a market capitalization of US$2.8t, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$63m over the year to September 2023. Notably, that's a decrease of 36% over the year before. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at US$3.0m.
In comparison with other companies in the American Tech industry with market capitalizations over US$8.0b, the reported median total CEO compensation was US$11m. Hence, we can conclude that Tim Cook is remunerated higher than the industry median. Moreover, Tim Cook also holds US$598m worth of Apple stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.

On an industry level, roughly 14% of total compensation represents salary and 86% is other remuneration. Apple has chosen to walk a path less trodden, opting to compensate its CEO with less of a traditional salary and more non-salary rewards over the last year. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.
A Look at Apple Inc.'s Growth Numbers
Apple Inc.'s earnings per share (EPS) grew 21% per year over the last three years. Revenue was pretty flat on last year.
This demonstrates that the company has been improving recently and is good news for the shareholders. The lack of revenue growth isn't ideal, but it is the bottom line that counts most in business. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future.
Has Apple Inc. Been A Good Investment?
Boasting a total shareholder return of 48% over three years, Apple Inc. has done well by shareholders. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.
In Summary...
Apple prefers rewarding its CEO through non-salary benefits. Given that the company's overall performance has been reasonable, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the upcoming AGM. Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.
While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business. That's why we did some digging and identified 2 warning signs for Apple that investors should think about before committing capital to this stock.
Arguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels. So check out this free list of interesting companies that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.

*Stock prices used were the afternoon prices of Feb. 20, 2024. The video was published on Feb. 22, 2024.","There was a time when an electric Tesla pickup, something designed to go head-to-head against America’s most popular products, the Ford F-150 and Chevrolet Silverado, seemed just the thing to take Tesla truly mainstream.
Then, in 2019, Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Cybertruck, a bare metal box on wheels. It’s the furthest thing from mainstream. This truck has attracted ardent fans and even more ardent critics. But it has good towing and hauling capabilities even though it sacrifices some usability to its literally edgy design. For some customers, the sacrifice is undoubtably worth it.
But it may be more of a question about whether Ford and GM really need to worry.
If it’s a contest for eyeballs, they do. Even when I parked a rented Tesla Cybertruck next to a hot-pink McLaren supercar in a shopping center parking lot in California, the people in the McLaren couldn’t stop talking about the Cybertruck. Everywhere I went, the huge, shiny silver truck was a crowd magnet, drawing young people who’d been waiting to see one in real life and others, usually older, who had no idea what this thing even was.
The Tesla Cybertruck looks like nothing else on the road. And its size – it’s not quite as long as a Ford F-150 but somehow looks even bigger – is even more eye-catching. Of course, once the Cybertruck has been on the market a while, its draw will subside.
There’s a lot to like about the Cybertruck, but it also embodies a disturbing level of individual arrogance in hard, unforgiving steel. Concerns for the safety of others on the road and even the practical needs of its own users appear to have been placed second to a design and engineering directive spearheaded by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk. As Walter Isaacson’s recent biography of Musk makes clear, it was Musk’s fixation on this structure, created from the same steel SpaceX uses for rockets, that resulted in the rectilinear mass of naked metal that I was driving through the southern California hills.
A sports-truck
It was the most enjoyable electric truck I’ve driven yet. I’ve driven nearly all the other electric trucks currently on the market such as Ford’s and Rivian’s and I don’t expect any will surpass the Cybertruck in its sports-car like performance. Ordinarily, not a priority in a pickup. It’s got powerful acceleration and steering that feels quick, responsive and nimble. With its punchy acceleration, quick steering and custom-designed Goodyear truck tires, it reminded me a bit of driving the Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato, a high-performance sports car fitted with off-road tires and raised suspension. But the Cybertruck is, of course, bigger and more than twice as heavy.
Even a mildly firm press on the accelerator left everyone else quickly behind. With its drive-by-wire steering system, a slight turn of its small, rectangular steering wheel yielded tight turns at lower speeds but, at higher speeds, it wasn’t hard to keep the truck in its lane. Four-wheel steering allows it to turn around in a smaller area than one might expect.
Tesla did not provide CNN with a Cybertruck to test. Instead, we rented one for over $1,000 for the day through Turo, the peer-to-peer vehicle rental service. (Turo doesn’t set the rates, vehicle owners do, and Cybertruck rates have come down somewhat since then.) My Turo host walked me through the Cybertruck’s various very weird – by non-Tesla standards – controls.
The turn signals are controlled using steering wheel buttons rather than a stalk. (Again, this is similar to a Lamborghini or Ferrari.) To put the truck in drive or reverse, I swiped up and down on a truck icon on the center screen. (In case the screen ever goes blank, there is a row of gear selector buttons on the ceiling just above the windshield.) And I had to dig a bit on the touchscreen to find the control for the Cybertruck’s one gigantic windshield wiper. Once I’d driven the truck an hour or so, though, everything seemed logical.
Um, what’s with the rearview mirror?
It does have a windshield-mounted rear-view mirror but, troublingly, it’s entirely useless most of the time. With the bed cover closed, there is nothing to see out the back window.
Many modern SUVs have rearview mirrors that double as a video screen showing a view from a camera mounted in the back. Tesla could have used a similar system but, no. In the Cybertruck the rear video view is displayed in a small rectangle in the truck’s center screen. It’s there all the time while you drive.
This may seem like a minor detail but it says a lot about how Tesla thinks about vehicle controls. The only reason to have the rearview video display inside the rearview mirror is because that’s where drivers are used to looking. Similarly, the only reason to have a turn signal stalk is that’s what people are used to. For better or worse, Tesla does not care what you’re used to.
There are indications this attitude contributes to higher crash rates but, if Tesla were inventing a vehicle from scratch the strange choices would be totally sensible.
Then there’s the Cybertruck’s crazy shape. Other companies have been making pickup trucks for well more than a century and there are reasons they’re not usually shaped like wedges. In this case, the Cybertruck is hindered by an apparent, needless desire to be different.
Not ideal for cargo
In the Cybertruck, if you load up the cargo bed then decide you want to reach something in the front, something close to the back window, you’ll need to start unpacking. There’s no reaching over the side of the bed to get at it. The side wall is just too high.
Unlike other large trucks, the Cybertruck also gives you nowhere to put your foot to help you reach over the cargo bed’s side other than the back tire, which could be slick with mud and dirt. There’s not even much room to stand on the back bumper.
The” frunk,” or front trunk, is also a fairly useless afterthought compared to the one on in the Ford F-150 Lightning. Ford’s is just bigger, to start with, and it has loads of power outlets making it a genuinely functional workspace. The Cybertruck’s is handy as, maybe, a place to sit. There is a fair-sized storage bin, though.
For now, at least, the Cybertruck isn’t in the same price range as the Lightning, either. The Foundation Series truck I drove cost over $100,000. It will be next year before Tesla has said it will start producing trucks costing around $60,000.
Most concerning, though, is the manufacturing quality. The interior is fairly nice, if spartan, but that’s the easy part, especially since Tesla does away with most switches. The hard part is making a body from stainless steel, especially one with mostly straight edges that don’t hide misalignments.
In most cars and trucks, body panel alignments are a purely cosmetic concern. It doesn’t look good when there are big, uneven gaps between different sections of the body. But most vehicles aren’t made from thick, hard-edged stainless steel. At the front corners of our Cybertruck there were gaps big enough to see daylight through and hard edges stuck out from the body.
On the edge
I worried if this truck hit a pedestrian or if someone slipped while climbing over the bed side that the unyielding metal could cause real harm. It’s not actually knife-edged, of course, but, hitting soft flesh with enough force, it seems like it could rip through skin. I emailed Tesla to ask if the automaker had any concerns about this, but I haven’t received a response. Tesla has not responded to CNN inquiries in years.
This is not a truck that customers will buy in big numbers, and not just because Tesla isn’t making them in big numbers, yet. It’s fun and it’s interesting but, for those who just want to get the job done, there’s not much reason to buy this instead of something more normal and functional. It doesn’t seem like it will do anything – or at least anything that matters – much better than a Ford F-150 Lightning or a Chevrolet Silverado EV and it will definitely be worse in some important ways.
If you want to draw a crowd, though, this is your ride. At least while the novelty lasts.","Elon Musk is not surprised by the bad news hitting Tesla rival Rivian. He’s been warning about it for some time.
On Wednesday, Rivian announced a disappointing quarter and outlook and said it would cut its salaried workforce by roughly 10%.
Shortly after, Musk wrote on X that the rival maker of electric vehicles would go bankrupt in about six quarters on the current trajectory, adding, “Maybe that trajectory will change, but so far it hasn’t.
“They need to cut costs massively, and the exec team needs to live in the factory or they will die,” he wrote.
Musk, having gone through “production hell” and “sleeping at the factory” himself at Tesla, should know.
The billionaire has warned about Rivian’s challenges before. In June 2022, he said his advice for the company would be “to cut costs immediately across the board dramatically or they’re doomed.”
After markets opened on Thursday, Rivian shares fell by as much as 26%, their biggest drop and lowest level since the company went public in 2021.
Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe pointed to high interest rates as one of the EV maker’s key challenges, something Musk has described as hampering Tesla as well.
“Our business is not immune to existing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, which has negatively impacted demand,” Scaringe said on an earnings call.
That’s not the only challenge.
EV slowdown
Sales growth of EVs, while still strong, has recently slowed, spurring Ford and GM to pare back their production plans. This is partly because early EV enthusiasts have already bought their vehicles, and regular car shoppers are more likely to be turned off by the higher prices, range anxiety, and poor resale value associated with EVs, among other concerns.
Tesla, in a call with investors, warned of “notably lower” sales growth this year after a disappointing fourth quarter. Musk said his EV maker is “between two major growth waves” as it aims to start production of a more affordable model late next year.
Meanwhile Toyota, the world’s top carmaker for four years running, and other legacy automakers are enjoying surging sales of hybrid vehicles, which many car buyers see as a more practical alternative to EVs.
On March 7, Rivian will unveil its R2, a midsize SUV that will take on Tesla’s popular Model Y and be priced at around $50,000. The model will be smaller and cheaper than what Rivian has offered so far.
“There is a lack of choice of highly compelling EV products in that $45,000 to $55,000 price range, recognizing the average price of a new vehicle transaction was around $48,000,” Scaringe said. “We remain very bullish on the R2 segment and the R2 product itself.”
But the R2 is expected to launch in 2026. Asked on CNBC whether a capital raise would be required to get to R2 production, Scaringe replied, “We are very confident in the capital we have supporting operations through the end of 2025.” He added the company is “driving efficiency into everything we do” and expected a fourth-quarter gross profit later this year.
But Rivian has a long way to go. It accounted for 4.2% of EV sales in the fourth quarter last year, compared with Tesla at 55.1%, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. The Tesla Model Y alone had 33.2% of the market.
And Tesla itself, of course, was recently topped in global EV sales by China’s BYD, chief among the Chinese EV makers striking fear into legacy automakers with their low production costs and rapidly expanding exports.
Musk, in another post following Rivian’s earnings call, wrote: “Their product design is not bad, but the actual hard part of making a car company work is achieving volume production with positive cash flow.”

The Model 3 is well-equipped, good to drive and has a competitive range
Introduction
What Car? says...
What with owner Elon Musk’s space ambitions and X/Twitter purchase, there’s so much noise around Tesla that you could almost forget that the company makes cars. Well, it does – and its best-known model is the Tesla Model 3.
The Model 3 is a fully electric car, and is also the US brand’s smallest and cheapest model. It sits below the Tesla Model S luxury saloon, and the Tesla Model X and Model Y SUVs in the car maker's (all-electric) line-up.
It's roughly the same size as a BMW 3 Series and there are two versions to choose from: an entry-level, rear-wheel drive, and a Long Range version designed to (yep, you guessed it) maximise the range between charges.
In the ever-expanding world of electric cars, the Model 3's closest rivals are the BMW i4, BYD Seal and Polestar 2. You might also find yourself considering the Hyundai Ioniq 6 and VW ID 7, or possibly higher-riding options, such as the Genesis GV60 and Kia EV6.
So, is the Tesla Model 3 better than those rival electric cars? Read on to find out...
Performance & drive
What it’s like to drive, and how quiet it is
Engine, 0-60mph and gearbox
Even the entry-level Tesla Model 3 – called the Rear-wheel Drive (RWD) – can officially sprint from 0-60mph in a rapid 5.8 seconds. That's much quicker than the equivalent Hyundai Ioniq 6 and on par with an entry-level BMW i4 or BYD Seal.
The four-wheel-drive Long Range version benefits from two electric motors rather than one, so it's even quicker. It’ll officially accelerate from 0-60mph in just 4.2 seconds, making it just as quick as a Porsche 911 Carrera 4 and slightly faster than the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor. A VW ID 7 would be left way behind.
On standard 18in wheels, the RWD has an official range of 318 miles, rising to 390 miles for the Long Range. It's worth taking these figures with a pinch of salt, though – in our 2024 winter real range test, a Long Range running on standard 18in aero alloys covered 293 miles before running out of charge. Expect a real-world range of around 340 miles in the summer months.
Suspension and ride comfort
The ride is firmer than in an adaptive suspension-equipped ID 7, but the upside is that the Model 3 has impressive body control on undulating country roads and it never thumps or crashes over urban imperfections.
If you want the best ride possible we would suggest sticking with the 18in wheels rather than stepping up to the optional 19s because having a thicker, spongier sidewall helps to take the sting out of sharp-edged abrasions.
Handling
Compared with its rivals, the Model 3 is relatively light, and that allows it to stay remarkably upright through turns while also generating plenty of grip.
It feels even more keen to change direction than the ID 7 and the Seal, plus its steering is super-accurate – although some drivers might prefer it to have a bit more heft when turning in to a corner.
The Model 3 is not the most expressive car in the bends, with a neutral handling balance that inspires confidence but doesn't thrill. If you want something a little more playful, you might prefer the Seal.
Noise and vibration
The Model 3 is, like many electric cars, whisper-quiet at town speeds, but as speeds increase you do start to hear some wind noise from around the double-glazed but pillarless side windows.
You don’t, however, get much road or suspension noise, which makes the Model 3 a relaxing long-distance companion. Indeed, when we got our decibel meter out it showed that at motorway speeds there's nothing in it between the i4, the Seal and the Model 3. Only the pricier ID 7 is noticeably quieter.
The brakes deserve a special mention for being far less grabby than those in many electric cars. They make it easy to slow down smoothly without your passengers thinking you’ve only just passed your driving test.
Driving overview
Strengths Rapid acceleration; agile handling; great range between charges; true one-pedal driving
Weaknesses BYD Seal is more fun in the bends
Interior
The interior layout, fit and finish
Driving position and dashboard
To keep the Tesla Model 3's dashboard looking as minimalist as a Scandinavian studio apartment, everything from the door mirrors to the height and reach of the steering wheel must be adjusted using a combination of the big central touchscreen and scroll buttons on the steering wheel. It’s a frustrating process and not advisable while driving.
We also don’t like that the Model 3 doesn’t have stalks on its steering column. Instead, there are haptic buttons on the steering to control the indicators, windscreen wipers and cruise control. You do eventually get used to it, but it seems like a solution to a problem that didn't exist.
Aside from the questionable ergonomics, the Model 3's driving position is good. You sit relatively high up by executive saloon standards (although still lower than in the Polestar 2), and the seat, steering wheel and pedals line up neatly.
Visibility, parking sensors and cameras
The front windscreen pillars are exceedingly thick and angled in such a way that they can badly hamper your view out at junctions. How badly will depend on your height and your general driving position, but it's fair to say that the BYD Seal and the Polestar 2 are no better in this regard.
More positively, the view out of the back is pretty good and all versions come with front and rear parking sensors, along with a surround-view camera.
LED headlights are standard and illuminate very well, although you can't have the matrix headlights available on some executive cars, including the BMW i4 and VW ID 7, which shape their beams to avoid dazzling other drivers.
Sat nav and infotainment
The Model 3 gets a big, bright 15.4in central infotainment touchscreen that is pretty intuitive to use and quick to respond once you’ve made your selection.
There are loads of useful features (navigation, web browsing and so on), apps (such as Netflix and Spotify) and some purely fun applications (driving games controlled using the steering wheel and the ability to make whoopee cushion noises to amuse your passengers).
You also get two easily accessible wireless phone-charging mats below the infotainment screen and a couple of high-powered USB-C ports for rapid device charging. Overall, it's a better system than you'll find in the Seal and Polestar 2, if not quite as easy to use as the iDrive system in the i4.
It's a bit disappointing that no Model 3 has Android Auto or Apple CarPlay smartphone mirroring. You get a free data connection (for watching films, browsing the internet etc) for 30 days, but after that you have to sign up to a subscription or use your phone's data allowance.
Quality
The Model 3's build quality is definitely the best we’ve seen from Tesla and it's more than a match for the Seal, and roughly on a par with the pricier ID 7.
There are soft-touch materials everywhere you touch, and while the faux leather on the seats and steering wheel doesn’t feel quite as premium as the leather you can have in an i4, everything else feels tactile and pleasant.
Interior overview
Strengths Minimalist interior feels upmarket; infotainment system is quick and packed with features; plenty of parking aids come as standard
Weaknesses Windscreen pillars hamper visibility at junctions; lack of stalks can be fiddly; speedo is on the central touchscreen
Passenger & boot space
How it copes with people and clutter
Front space
No one sitting in the front of a Tesla Model 3 is going to complain about space – no matter how tall they are. There’s also loads of room for odds and ends, with a couple of lidded cubbies between the front seats, as well as front door bins that can each take a big bottle of water.
The front seat area feels remarkably light and airy, with a combination of tall side windows and a standard panoramic glass roof.
Rear space
Not only does the Model 3 have plenty of rear head and legroom, but thanks to tall side windows and a broad glass roof it also feels pleasingly airy – something you can't say about the i4. Middle rear passengers also have plenty of space for their knees and feet, with no central hump in the floor to straddle.
However, if you want a car with limo-like space in the rear, we'd point you in the direction of the VW ID 7. In that car, six-footers are able to stretch out behind a driver of a similar height, something that isn't possible in the Model 3. The ID 7's rear bench also has the best under-thigh support of any car in the class, making it comfortable on long journeys.
Seat folding and flexibility
The Model 3’s rear seatback splits in a 60/40 arrangement and can be folded down when you need to carry long loads.
Some electric rivals, including the Hyundai Ioniq 6 and the Polestar 2, have 60/40 split-folding rear seats too, but the BMW i4 and the iD 7 offer a more flexible 40/20/40 split as standard.
There are no clever features, such as sliding or reclining rear seats in the Model 3, but then there aren't in any traditional executive car rivals either.
Boot space
The Model 3 is a saloon, so its boot aperture isn’t huge. However, there’s more space for luggage than you’ll find in conventional executive rivals (the Audi A4 and the BMW 3 Series for example) as well as many electric alternatives, including the i4, BYD Seal, Ioniq 6, Polestar 2 and VW ID 7.
That’s thanks partly to a huge well under the main boot floor, but also the extra storage in the ""frunk"" under the bonnet. In total, we managed to squeeze in an impressive total of nine carry-on suitcases into the Model 3's two boots. A buggy or a couple of sets of golf clubs shouldn't prove a problem.
All versions have an electric tailgate that can be opened and closed using the touchscreen, from the Tesla app on your phone or by pressing a button on the boot lid itself.
Practicality overview
Strengths Big boot with lots of underfloor storage; good read head and leg room; plenty of storage in the front
Weaknesses Saloon boot hinders practicality; and ID 7 is even roomier in the back
Buying & owning
Everyday costs, plus how reliable and safe it is
Costs, insurance groups, MPG and CO2
The Model 3 is the least expensive car Tesla makes, and our favourite entry-level RWD version undercuts pretty much every rival, including the BMW i4, BYD Seal, Hyundai Ioniq 6, Polestar 2 and VW ID 7.
Like all pure electric cars, the Model 3 makes a huge amount of sense for company car drivers because of the enormous benefit-in-kind (BIK) tax savings on offer. Plus, if you can charge your car at home, you’ll spend less on electricity than you would on petrol or diesel.
Buying a Model 3 gives you access to Tesla’s Supercharger network and impressive maximum charging speeds (up to 170kW for the RWD and 250kW for the Long Range), allowing you to charge the battery (from 10-80%) in less than 30 minutes. You have to pay each time, but the price is reasonable, and the network is more extensive and reliable than any other. That's a big reason to buy the Model 3 over, for example, the Polestar 2.
Of course, you can still charge up at any CCS public charging point if you need to, but it will take longer. A full 0-100% charge at home using a 7kW charger takes around 12 hours in a Model 3 Long Range, and roughly nine hours in the entry-level RWD model.
Equipment, options and extras
All versions of the Model 3 come with plenty of luxuries, including climate control, adaptive cruise control, faux-leather seats (heated and ventilated in the front and heated in the rear), a heated steering wheel and keyless entry using an app on your smartphone.
Other than an upgraded stereo system with 17 speakers instead of the standard 14, there’s no equipment difference between the Long Range and the entry-level RWD. That's one of the reasons why the RWD is our recommended version.
It’s a good thing the Model 3 is so well equipped as standard, because there isn’t much on the options list. Indeed, apart from metallic paint, different alloy wheel designs and white (instead of black) seats, the only options are Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self Driving Capability.
Those last two features allow the Model 3 to make lane changes on its own (just hit the indicator), steer itself into a parking space and even be ""summoned"" with a smartphone app at very low speeds. So, if someone parks too close in a car park for you to open the doors, you can drive it out of the space using your phone.
Reliability
The Model 3 comes with a four-year/50,000-mile warranty. The battery and drive unit are covered separately for eight years and 100,000 miles on the entry-level (RWD) model, or eight years and 120,000 miles on the Long Range version. That covers the electrical bits against faults and guarantees a minimum 70% retention of battery capacity.
Tesla finished in a respectable tenth place out of 32 car makers in the 2023 What Car? Reliability Survey. Meanwhile, the pre-facelift Model 3 did quite well too, coming eighth out of 20 models in the electric car category.
Safety and security
The Model 3 is one of the safest cars ever tested by Euro NCAP – it scored exceptionally well for its ability to protect occupants in an accident and help you avoid a crash in the first place. The suite of standard safety aids includes blind-spot monitoring and automatic emergency braking (AEB).
As for security, as well as the usual kit, there’s something called Sentry mode. When enabled, it uses the car’s external cameras to start recording when the car is approached after it’s locked, saving the footage to a USB drive. If anyone tries to break in or if someone drives into your Model 3 when it's parked up, the cameras will record it.
Buying & owning overview
Strengths Attractively priced; access to Tesla Supercharger network; all versions are well equipped; excellent Euro NCAP safety score
Weaknesses Huge price jump from RWD to the Long Range model

We expect global car sales growth to moderate this year after a strong 2023, which was driven by pent-up demand. The three key regions, the US, China and Europe, are all expected to maintain a mild positive trend. Meanwhile, we think the electrification process may slow although the upward trend should continue
Strong growth recorded in 2023
Global auto sales recorded strong growth in 2023, exceeding our positive expectations. According to Moody's estimates, global car sales expanded at a robust rate of +10.8% year-on-year. Car sales recorded a double-digit rate of growth in all three major geographical markets last year, rising +12.4% in the United States, +11.0% in China and +13.7% in Europe (comprising the EU, UK and EFTA markets). Light vehicle sales in the United States, China and Western Europe increased last year by +13.3%, +12.0% and +14.2%, respectively, according to Moody’s statistics which we have been using for our historical data and forecasts. Importantly, the Chinese growth includes a contribution from China’s car exports (up approximately 58% YoY), whereas domestic sales grew by 6.0%, according to Moody’s (+5.6% according to the China Passenger Car Association, when excluding imported cars and commercial vehicles). The strong growth reflected pent-up demand that had been realised after delays with production and delivery experienced in the prior years.
Momentum to slow this year but remain positive
In 2024, we expect this positive sales momentum to continue but at a much slower pace after a strong increase in the previous year and given a muted macroeconomic backdrop. Another factor reflected in our forecasts is the expected slowdown in the rate of proliferation of electric vehicles, which has been supportive during the last couple of years. Currently, we forecast global car sales growth of +2.6% in 2024.
Global car sales growth rate set to slow
In terms of regions, we assume car sales growth of +2.0% in the United States, +3.0% in China (including exports) and +1.5% in the European market. Our cautious outlook for sales growth across the regions stems from the muted economic outlook for this year across the key geographies with consumer confidence still subdued. With interest rates remaining more elevated right now and second-hand car prices falling, demand for new vehicles is more muted. In addition, as we will discuss later, we expect slower demand for new electric cars during the current year. We also expect Chinese export sales growth to slow after a very strong jump in 2023 while domestic demand may also be less strong. We will monitor our forecasts as the year evolves as new supportive or negative factors may come to the forefront.
We expect relatively flat production volumes in the current year
We anticipate that light vehicle production volumes will stay flat or increase only slightly year-on-year in 2024. This is because we believe that after the robust rates of production growth during the past two years, in excess of the respective yearly sales volumes, inventories have now been rebuilt sufficiently to allow for more balanced production volumes relative to sales volumes. In fact, a flattish rate of production growth should still allow for the replenishment and maintenance of inventories at sufficient levels given a more modest expected rate of growth in sales relative to 2023.
Auto makers' margins to soften this year
We would expect the profit margins of automakers to come under some pressure during the current year after a period of above-average profitability in the post-pandemic period when OEM’s had relative pricing power and greater influence over the mix of sales. While we anticipate margins softening in 2024 year-on-year, we do not expect, and so far the car manufacturers are not flagging, a particularly pronounced margin dilution this year either. Conversely, we expect that auto parts manufacturers have a higher chance of maintaining or even slightly expanding their margins in 2024. This is because we believe that they will benefit from the tail-end effect of the earlier price adjustments and cost cuts implemented during the prior years. We also note that lower raw material prices should present tailwinds for both car and auto parts manufacturers.
Sense of reality for electrification while the upward trend continues
The global penetration rate of electric cars (EVs) continued to increase to 17% of new sales over 2023 (battery electric vehicles BEV + plug-in hybrid electric vehicles PHEV), but the regional picture is currently more mixed. The main engine is still China, also the world’s largest market. With continued fiscal support, an abundance of production capacity and well-developed regional supply chains, Chinese new EV sales hit 9m last year (30% of total sales), making up the vast majority of global sales. Chinese-built cars also gained more traction in the rest of the world. Exports of vehicles - including those of BYD (which overtook Tesla as the largest BEV producer in 4Q 2023) soared (+57%) and growth is set to continue in 2024 as they seem to be meeting customers' needs. Europe is increasingly wary of the adverse effects of dumping and started an investigation that may lead to extra levies, although not before the end of the year.
At the same time, Europe and also the US, face a slowdown in EV uptake compared to previous expectations. The main reason behind this is the scaling back of subsidies in large car markets, while subsidies are currently still an important driver for EV sales growth. In particular, the sudden termination of purchase subsidies in Europe’s largest market, Germany, will be a drag on EV sales into 2024 and the ending of subsidies has also stalled the further uptake in the UK. But there are more reasons:
- Residual values of EVs are under significant pressure because of price cuts for new cars. This leads to a more cautious approach among leasing and rental companies. As such, rental companies, Hertz and Sixt, also decided to trim their EV fleets in the US and Europe.
- EVs are often financed and the combination of higher interest rates and lower residual values pushes up monthly leasing terms.
- New EV drivers increasingly have to rely on public charging infrastructure and this hasn’t kept up with electrification in countries that have seen a surge recently. The opening of Tesla’s charging network to others can only create some extra charging opportunities.
Chinese EV rate steams ahead while lower prices support demand in Europe and US
Despite the current slackening in demand, the electrification trend inevitably continues and EV rates are still expected to hit 25% in Europe (from 23%). The US is behind in the market penetration of EVs but, supported by IRA subsidies, its share is still expected to go up to 11% in 2024, although this is less than previously anticipated. Moderation of demand, combined with receding (battery) raw material prices and largely resolved supply chain constraints puts average EV prices on a downward track again since the last few months of 2023. And gradually, newly introduced models are contributing to this. Increasing affordability brings electric cars closer to break-even again for car drivers, which is a positive signal for 2024. After rounds of reductions, a Tesla model Y now sells below the average car price in the US.
Within Europe, the differences are still large. A positive element in this is that lagging countries will have to catch up in light of a complete shift to zero emissions in 2035. As such, Europe’s fourth largest market, Italy, with a lagging total EV share of just 9% (BEV + PHEV) is expected to implement a subsidy scheme this year, which supports Europe’s total figure.
In China, there are still not many signs of a slowdown. The Chinese car market is less mature, and it benefits from growing car ownership (first buyers opting for EVs) and the government is keeping its hands on the subsidy tap. We therefore expect the pace of growth to continue, with EVs reaching a share of 35% in 2024. Nevertheless, the adoption of electric cars is increasingly spreading from early adaptors to middle-class drivers in China, which comes with more concerns around charging possibilities (although battery swapping is seen as a promising concept in the country).
EV shares continue to climb, while Europe faces a slowdown and the US lags
Share of electric vehicles (BEV + PHEV) in total new car registrations per region
Competition mounts in EV race – manufacturers in strategic balancing act between margins and repositioning for the future
Exporting Chinese car manufacturers have increased the competition in the global EV market. In the run-up to 2024, Tesla added to the pressure by reducing its new prices several times to keep production figures growing. Other car makers were forced to follow suit, such as Ford with its Mustang Mach E. But this eats into margins that are already small or still negative. The pressure on new EV prices challenges new and incumbent manufacturers to reduce costs and puts them in a difficult strategic position. On the one hand, they are pressed to temporise EV production increases as conventional cars still generate higher margins. On the other hand, progress is important to secure future market share in the run-up to 2030, when EVs will likely see more traction among drivers with further improving economics and improved charging infrastructure. Together with the extra time required to bring local production of batteries up to speed (and reduce dependency on China), several of them including Ford and GM in the US decided to push back production ambitions for EVs. In Europe there have been announcements of delays as well, such as for VW's ID.2. Manufacturers face a new European CO2-emission hurdle in 2025 (-15% vs 2021) for the average production, but they can still work around it by buying emission credits from Tesla (delivering $9bn in 2023). But the tumbling share prices of pure EV players also indicate that the EV transition is increasingly putting them under pressure too, indicating that some brands will not survive as the market restructures and matures.

Read more","Rivian said on Wednesday it would cut its workforce by 10% and forecast EV production this year that widely missed estimates, hurt by downtime for factory upgrades and slowing demand for electric vehicles due to high interest rates.
Shares of the company tumbled about 17% in extended trading after Rivian said it expects to produce 57,000 vehicles in 2024, well below estimates of 81,700 units, according to eight analysts polled by Visible Alpha. It produced 57,232 vehicles last year.
""We firmly believe in the full electrification of the automotive industry, but recognize in the short-term, the challenging macro-economic conditions,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement on Wednesday.
Amazon.com-backed Rivian has been burning through cash to ramp up production of its R1S SUV and R1T pickup trucks as it spends on building a new factory in Georgia and loses thousands of dollars on every vehicle it builds.
The company's cash burn comes at a time when demand for EVs has slowed, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk warning that high interest rates are making cars unaffordable.
After shying away from reducing the price of its vehicles last year despite a price war sparked by Tesla, Rivian this month cut the price of its R1T pickup trucks and R1S SUVs by $3,100.
Meanwhile, Lucid also forecast production for 2024 that was much lower than Wall Street's expectations, even after it cut prices of its Lucid Air luxury electric sedans last week.
Rivian's cash and cash equivalents were $7.86 billion at the end of the December quarter, compared with $7.94 billion in the preceding three-month period.
It also recorded a 10% fall in deliveries in the fourth quarter, missing estimates, citing lack of deliveries to Amazon in the three-month period to focus on the holiday period.
However, revenue for the October-December period stood at $1.32 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $1.26 billion, according to LSEG data.
Rivian has been posting a loss on every vehicle it sells and expects to record its first quarter of positive gross margin later this year.
The company's R2 platform, which is expected to be cheaper and smaller, is set to be unveiled early next month.
The company reported a net loss of $1.52 billion for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $1.72 billion a year earlier.","Apple, Tesla downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls
The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.
Top 5 Upgrades:
Deutsche Bank upgraded Southwest (LUV) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $42, up from $28. The firm believes more moderate domestic available seat mile growth for 2024 will have positive implications for domestic unit revenue performance, and by extension, should translate into solid sales performance for the domestic-focused names. As such, Deutsche upgraded Alaska (ALK), JetBlue (JBLU), and Southwest to Buy from Hold. Meanwhile, Bernstein also upgraded Southwest to Market Perform from Underperform with a price target of $32, up from $26.
UBS upgraded US Foods (USFD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $64, up from $47. Following the company's Q4 results, UBS is becoming more bullish on US Foods based on expectations for further market share gains on the back of sales force investments and its differentiated tech platform as well as higher conviction that the company's EBITDA growth trajectory is sustainable. Piper Sandler also upgraded US Foods to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $59, up from $45.
B. Riley upgraded Brunswick (BC) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $108, up from $100.

Top 5 Initiations:

Jim Cramer says Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is a bigger visionary than Elon Musk
CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday he believes Jensen Huang — the co-founder and CEO of leading artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia — is a bigger visionary than billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, whose panoply of companies includes Tesla , rocket maker SpaceX and brain-tech startup Neuralink. ""I think that Musk can see around the corner, but I think that Jensen is thinking about a legacy of changing the entire paradigm about the way the world is,"" Cramer said Thursday on ""Squawk on the Street."" Cramer's Charitable Trust, the portfolio used by the CNBC Investing Club, has long been invested in Nvidia. Cramer has espoused the brilliance of Huang for years and even re-named his dog Nvidia. Cramer has likened Huang to Leonardo da Vinci . Ahead of earnings this time, Cramer equated Huang to popstar Taylor Swift , saying their success is unparalleled in their respective fields. ""Jensen is creating, singlehandedly, an industrial revolution. And Musk is creating, singlehandedly, a way to be able to deliver things,"" Cramer continued. ""Those are both brilliant things, without a doubt, but to create an industrial revolution yourself — to create the loom, to create the train, to create the steamboat — who does those things?"" Cramer's comments came after Nvidia's quarterly earnings report a night earlier exceeded Wall Street's sky-high expectations. The AI chip firm delivered better-than-expected results for the three months ended in January and issued strong guidance for the current quarter, offering evidence that the generative AI boom that's been underway since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 is marching on. NVDA TSLA 5Y mountain Nvidia's stock performance compared with Tesla's over the past five years. Nvidia's chips — known as graphics processing units, or GPUs —are at the heart of the boom, providing the computing power needed to train the models underpinning ChatGPT and other AI applications. Demand for Nvidia's products has far exceeded supply over the past year as cloud-computing providers like Microsoft and other companies invest heavily in the technology. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Its GPUs were initially used to render graphics for video games, but their potential for AI applications became widely apparent in the 2000s, setting the stage for the explosive growth the company has seen in its data-center business in recent years. In the 12 months ended Jan. 28, Nvidia's revenue more than doubled from a year ago to $60.9 billion. Nvidia's valuation has soared, too. The Santa Clara, California-based firm is the third-most valuable company in the S & P 500 , with a market capitalization of nearly $1.9 trillion, based on Thursday's stock price. Its market value trails only Microsoft and Apple , both of which Cramer's Trust owns. Tesla, which also is among the most valuable U.S. companies, carried a market cap of around $615 billion Thursday. Over the years, Cramer has certainly given Musk his due, calling out the Tesla CEO's mercurial genius, incredible work ethic, and the way he brings attention to his companies. In 2019, Cramer said Musk is the P.T. Barnum of our time . Barnum's exploits in the mid-to-late 1800s, as the master promoter of what became the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Of course, since then, Musk has bought Twitter. And, renamed it into X.",,,
MSFT,"Meetings with a company’s top brass can provide invaluable insights into its inner workings and shine a light on the opportunities available.
After spending almost a full day with some of Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) senior management team at its Redmond base, Bernstein’s Mark Moerdler, a 5-star analyst rated in the top 2% of the Street’s stock pros, walked away seriously impressed.
“The company has a high sense of energy and excitement, and you can sense the speed it is moving at and the desire to move even more quickly,” Moerdler noted. “The innovation level is high, and Microsoft is extremely well-positioned to capture so much of the upside from that innovation, which is why Microsoft continues to be our favorite long-term investment. After having held these meetings, we are even more excited about the long-term prospects for the business and Microsoft’s ability to drive strong revenue growth, margin improvement and return of cash.”
So, what specifically got Moerdler so excited? Obviously, the AI opportunity was a focal point. Microsoft acknowledges that they are at the forefront of the Generative AI trend, setting the standard in contrast to previous cycles, such as the Cloud, where they were playing catch-up. This represents a significant shift for the company, and they are determined to maintain their edge.
“In fact,” adds Moerdler, “even compared to the Cloud transition where the sense of drive was high, this time it is even higher and there is more excitement within the organization.”
AI permeates every aspect of Microsoft’s operations, spanning both the SaaS and IaaS/PaaS segments. This interconnectedness fosters a “feedback loop” that few, if any, other companies can utilize to fuel ongoing innovation and widespread adoption.
The good news is that AI development is still in its infancy, and although management has a “line of sight to revenue,” the broader long-term opportunities are still taking shape. As such, Moerdler anticipates that the tech giant will refrain from setting specific long-term goals or targets. That’s no cause for concern, however, as Microsoft is “executing really well and is simultaneously focused on driving growth while driving margins.”
While Moerdler was already a big fan ahead of the meetings, the analyst came away even more enthusiastic about the long-term outlook. As investors “recognize near term the value being created,” there’s potential for the stock to become interesting sooner than Moerdler previously anticipated.
Bottom-line, Moerdler maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on MSFT shares to go along with a $465 price target. Should the figure be met, investors will be sitting on returns of 13% a year from now. (To watch Moerdler’s track record, click here)
Almost no one is arguing with that take on Wall Street. MSFT’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 33 Buys and just 1 Hold and Sell each. At $469.58, the average target implies shares will gain 14% over the one-year timeframe. (See Microsoft stock forecast)

Wall Street is particularly bullish about tech stocks now. Excitement about budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) and easing inflation sent the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index up 47% since last February.
As the world's two most valuable companies and leaders in tech, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have seen their shares rise 54% and 18% during the period. These companies are some of the most attractive ways to invest in the industry, with one a king in productivity software and the other leading the consumer tech market.
Microsoft and Apple have long histories of delivering consistent stock growth, and that looks unlikely to change. Over the last year, Microsoft emerged as one of the biggest names in AI. Meanwhile, Apple is home to a highly profitable services business and is gaining market share in the virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) industry.
So, let's examine these businesses and determine whether Microsoft or Apple is the better tech stock this February.
Microsoft
In January, Microsoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company, with its market cap at just over $3 trillion.
The company is a tech behemoth with positions in multiple areas of the industry, leading in productivity software, game consoles, cloud computing, and operating systems. Its diverse business model allows it to profit from tailwinds across tech, making its stock an exceptionally reliable option.
Since 2019, Microsoft's annual revenue climbed 68%, with operating income up 106%. Additionally, its free cash flow jumped 76% to $67 billion.
The company has significant cash reserves, allowing it to keep investing in its business and retain its prominent role in tech. Microsoft became a leader in AI after sinking billions into ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The partnership granted Microsoft access to some of the sector's most advanced AI models, which it used to carve out a lucrative position in the budding industry.
The AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, which would see it hit nearly $2 trillion before the end of the decade.
Meanwhile, Microsoft used OpenAI's technology to introduce AI features across its product lineup. In 2023, Microsoft added new AI tools to its Azure cloud platform, integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and boosted productivity in its Office software suite with the help of AI.
Apple
Apple hasn't had it as easy as Microsoft in the last year. In 2023, macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company, leading to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines.
The streak was finally broken in Apple's latest quarter, with revenue rising 2% year over year to $120 billion in the first quarter of 2024. The company beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.
However, outperforming estimates wasn't enough to quell investor concern over its iPhone business, with its stock down nearly 6% year to date. Smartphone sales rose 6% in Q1 2024, yet fell 13% in China. The country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market.
As a result, it's promising that the company is expanding its product lineup and prioritizing digital markets like services to lean less on iPhone sales over the long term.
The company released the Vision Pro, its first VR/AR headset, earlier this year. Launching at $3,499, the new device created significant hype for the technology. If the company employs a similar pricing strategy to that used with past products and brings down the cost with subsequent generations, an investment in Apple could be an investment in the future leader of the VR/AR market.
The VR market alone is expected to grow at a CAGR of 31% until at least 2030. It could be smart to invest in the tech giant at the very start of its journey into the industry.
Alongside free cash flow that hit $107 billion last year, Apple has the funds to overcome current headwinds and keep investing in high-growth areas of tech.
Is Microsoft or Apple the better tech stock?
Microsoft and Apple have exciting long-term outlooks, with opportunities to profit from multiple subsectors of tech.
However, Microsoft's more significant priority on digital markets like cloud computing and AI makes it less vulnerable to macroeconomic headwinds and potentially the more reliable buy.
Meanwhile, earnings-per-share estimates indicate Microsoft has more growth potential than Apple in the near term.
Microsoft's earnings could hit just under $16 per share, while Apple's may reach nearly $8 per share in the next two fiscal years. Multiplying those figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Microsoft's 35 and Apple's 28) yields a stock price of $546 for Microsoft and $218 for Apple.
Looking at their current positions, these projections would see Microsoft's stock rise by 35% and Apple's increase by 20% by fiscal 2026. If these projections are correct, Microsoft has significantly more room to run and is the better tech stock to buy this month.

London Stock Exchange-listed biz confirmed yesterday that Sam Mudd is being appointed as a caretaker until a permanent successor is found.
BTG said yesterday that Murphy, who has run the business since October 1997, had tendered his resignation ""effective today,"" adding: ""Neil Murphy has also notified the Board today that he has made a number of trades in the Company's shares that had not been disclosed to the Company or the market in compliance with the PDMR disclosure requirements.""
The directors on the board are currently ""working to clarify the details of these undisclosed trades,"" and based on information provided, Murphy has a shareholding of 2,890,218 units, which remains unchanged from the position notified to the LSE on 28 November, 2023.
Soon-to-be replacement CEO Mudd is currently the executive director of BTG and managing director of Phoenix Software Lit. Phoenix was acquired by BTG in 2017 in a buy that opened the door to agreements with Dell, VMware, Checkpoint, Citrix, and Mimecast.

Start-up firms in artificial intelligence can’t afford to keep the lights on.

First, the infrastructure needed to build AI has become exorbitantly expensive. Second, most of that value is still — still! — held by a handful of large technology companies — and the oligopoly is only going to get worse.
For all the competition that was spurred by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, and the flurry of new startups that jumped into the hyped-up generative AI market, most of those new players will likely fold or be folded into the incumbents over the next year or so.

Recently, the 29-year-old founder and CEO appeared in Shark Tank and won a deal worth $300,000 (about Rs 2.5 crore). The idea for Flora, De said on the ABC show, occurred to him after he ended up killing one of his mother’s favorite plants during the Covid pandemic.
“My dear mother gave me her prized rose bush plant that she had for years,” De said on Shark Tank. “And I ended up killing it in eight short days.”
During his pitch to the sharks, De said that Flora's $64 (about Rs 5,300) soil meter and app takes “the guesswork out of plant care, by telling you exactly what moisture, temperature, light and other vitals your plans need.”
The company also offers perks such as 24x7 “plant diagnosis” support, access to “expert plant doctors” and the ability for one soil meter to support multiple houseplants.

Key Takeaways
- Aabesh De quit working at Microsoft three years ago to focus on…his houseplants.
- “My dear mother gave me her prized rose bush plant that she had for years,"" De said on Shark Tank. “And I ended up killing it in eight short days.""
- So De created the Flora Pod, and scored a $300,000 deal on Shark Tank.
Three years ago, Aabesh De quit his customer service job at Microsoft to work on an idea that became his plant sensor startup, Flora. On a ""Shark Tank"" episode that aired on February 16, the 29-year-old founder and CEO earned a deal worth $300,000 for his houseplant care solutions.
Shark Tank investor Lori Greiner gave De $300,000 for 15% equity and 5% in advisory shares, along with a $2 per unit royalty until she recoups her investment. De revealed that Flora brought in $192,000 in gross sales last year, but isn't yet profitable.
Flora came to life when De tried and failed to keep his houseplants alive during the pandemic. He was overwhelmed by the plethora of articles out there, and the different instructions that were needed to care for various species of houseplants. More personally, he was frustrated that every plant he touched kept dying — even a prized plant that his mom gave him.

De was looking for a product that could act as a wellness tracker for his plants. When he couldn't find it, he invented it — the Flora Pod is a small $64 attachment that goes beyond the surface of the soil of an indoor or outdoor plant and acts as a coach to keep the plant alive. It makes sure that the plant is getting enough water and light and lets the user know if anything is amiss.

Another Flora offering is the popular app, which has reached more than 300,000 people in 190 countries. The pod isn't required to use the app; app users can set customized reminders, scan their plant to get information about its species, and earn game-like rewards as they care for their plants.
Flora also offers locally sourced houseplants for sale online.
De started his business from scratch, teaching himself what he needed to know about electronics and computer science so that he could build the prototype moisture sensor for the Flora Pod and code the Flora iOS app.

GOOG,"The Ultimate Growth Stock to Buy With $1,000 Right Now
Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) owns and operates some of the most widely used digital properties on Earth. There are no other websites in the world that are visited more than the company's two key assets, Google and YouTube. And Alphabet has many other products and services that consumers, businesses, and governments need in their daily lives.
This success has made Alphabet a winning investment in the past. Shares have soared 367% in the last decade, a gain that far exceeds the 272% rise of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index.
Here's why I think this is the best growth stock to buy with $1,000 right now.
Strong financial performance
The days of Alphabet posting greater-than-20% year-over-year revenue growth might be gone. But despite macro headwinds that rattled the economy, particularly higher interest rates, inflationary pressures, and ongoing economic uncertainty, the company reported a sales gain of 9.8% in 2022 and 8.7% last year. This is healthy expansion given the slowdown in the digital ad market.
Alphabet is also incredibly profitable. Thanks to cost-cutting measures implemented to right-size operations, like eliminating tens of thousands of workers, the operating margin expanded to 27% in Q4 2023, up from 24% in the prior-year period. The business has shown its ability to boost the bottom line at a faster clip than revenue, a clear sign of its economies of scale.
Turning our attention from the income statement to the balance sheet, Alphabet proves once again that it's a superior enterprise. As of Dec. 31, it had roughly $111 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This compared to just $13 billion of long-term debt. This favorable situation reduces financial risk, while giving Alphabet the valuable ability to continue investing aggressively in growth opportunities no matter what the economic backdrop looks like.
One of the widest moats around
Google Search, which brought in more than half of the company's revenue last quarter, remains Alphabet's bread-and-butter segment. With 91% of the global market for search activity, this product has a monopoly in the industry, even with all the attention that has gone to OpenAI's ChatGPT and its integration with Microsoft's Bing.
Google Search benefits from powerful network effects. As the internet expands and the amount of information grows, users will depend more and more on Google Search's ability to organize all of this. And because of all this activity, marketers will continue to spend ad dollars on this three-sided platform.
Besides the network effect, which on its own is probably one of the strongest sources of economic moat on the face of the planet, Alphabet benefits from having a data advantage because of the billions of users that interact with its products and services daily. In the internet age, one in which the world is becoming increasingly digital, this gives the business another edge.
Valuation and growth
Thanks to such an impressive past performance for the stock, coupled with this being one of the most successful enterprises of all time, Alphabet today carries a market cap of over $1.7 trillion. This makes it the sixth-most-valuable business in the world. But that doesn't mean that shares can't reward investors going forward.
As of this writing, the stock sells for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.4. The current valuation looks extremely attractive relative to those of other ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, as Alphabet trades at a lower P/E multiple than all of them.
Looking ahead, Wall Street is optimistic. Analysts expect revenue and diluted earnings per share to rise at annualized rates of 10.6% and 15.3%, respectively, between 2023 and 2026. While it's always a good idea to take these forecasts with a grain of salt, based on the company's track record, investors have every right to remain bullish.
Allocating $1,000 to Alphabet looks to be a smart financial decision.

The Ultimate Growth Stock to Buy With $1,000 Right Now was originally published by The Motley Fool",,"Where should you invest your hard-earned money? That's probably the hardest question any investor faces. Different individuals arrive at different conclusions, of course.
I think, though, that three stocks especially stand out right now as excellent choices. Here are my picks for the best stocks to invest $5,000 in right now.
1. Alphabet
Two technologies hold the potential to transform our world over the next few decades -- artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing. Alphabet (GOOG -0.02%) (GOOGL -0.09%) is a leader in both of them.
The company's recent launch of its Gemini AI model proves that it won't be left behind in the AI race. Gemini Ultra beat the top AI models available (including GPT-4) on 30 of 32 key benchmarks. It's also the first AI system to outperform human experts on the MMLU (massive multitask language understanding) test, which includes 57 subjects.
I fully expect future versions of Gemini will be even more powerful. That's great news for Google Cloud, as more customers move their apps and data to the cloud to harness the power of AI.
Quantum computing still has a long way to go. However, Alphabet has achieved two key milestones. The company thinks it could realistically develop a functional commercial quantum computer within the next decade.
In the meantime, Alphabet is highly profitable with a huge cash stockpile. The company dominates multiple markets, including search. Its valuation also isn't as ridiculously high as many other top AI stocks. Alphabet's shares are trading at less than 21x forward earnings.
2. PayPal Holdings
You might be surprised to see PayPal Holdings (PYPL 1.39%) on this list. The fintech stock has been a big loser in recent years and is down more than 20% over the last 12 months.
But this steep sell-off has caused PayPal's shares to become dirt cheap. The stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of less than 11.6x. Is PayPal a value trap? I don't think so.
The company's business continues to perform relatively well, even though growth isn't as impressive as in the past. PayPal's revenue jumped 9% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023 and adjusted earnings per share soared 19%.
PayPal's Braintree payments platform, which processes credit cards, debit cards, and more, is an especially important growth driver. The company also has solid growth opportunities with its Venmo peer-to-peer payment offering.
3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.78%) is arguably one of the most resilient stocks on the market. The big-biotech's shares jumped in 2022 when the overall market plunged and last year, when the market was booming. Over the last 12 months, Vertex's share price has more than doubled.
I expect those winning ways to continue. Vertex recently won U.S. and U.K. approvals for Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The gene-editing therapy is effectively a cure for the two rare genetic diseases. Casgevy looks like a sure-fire megablockbuster.
Vertex expects to file for regulatory approvals for two other drugs this summer. VX-548 has significant potential as a non-opioid treatment for acute pain. The company's vanzacaftor triple-drug combo could be its most powerful and most profitable cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy yet.
Speaking of CF, Vertex still has plenty of growth opportunities in this market. The company continues to push for label expansions of its already-approved therapies to treat younger children and secure additional reimbursements.
More game-changing therapies could be on the way. Vertex is advancing inaxaplin into late-stage testing as a treatment for APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKS). There are currently no approved drugs that treat the underlying cause of AMKD, and the disease affects more patients than CF does worldwide. In addition, Vertex has multiple programs in early-stage testing that hold the potential to cure type 1 diabetes.",,"Alphabet stock (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) is now my largest tech holding, making up about 8% of my portfolio. Lately, I have added multiple times to my position, as Alphabet’s Q4 results showed strong revenue growth, expanding margins, surging profits, and increasing capital returns. Further, even though Alphabet retains double-digit top and bottom-line growth prospects, the stock appears cheap both independently and compared to the Magnificent Seven stocks. Thus, I remain bullish on the stock.
Q4 Results Reinforced My Conviction in the Stock
I have recently increased my Alphabet position multiple times, with its Q4 results further reinforcing my conviction in the stock’s bull case. To begin with, Alphabet posted reaccelerating revenue growth of 13% to $83.6 billion — a notable uptick from the previous quarter’s 11% and last year’s 1%.
Furthermore, EPS surged 56% to $1.64, as the bottom line was also boosted by an expansion in Alphabet’s operating margin from 24% to 27%. Notably, Q4’s revenues and EPS beat prior consensus estimates by 1.2% and 2.5%, respectively, surpassing market expectations. Let’s take a closer look.
Google, YouTube Drive Strong Advertising Momentum Backed by AI
Strength in Google and YouTube were the primary drivers of Alphabet’s revenue growth in Q4. Google Search revenues surged 13% to $48 billion, while YouTube advertising revenues grew by an even more significant 16% to $9.2 billion. The results benefited from an improving advertising environment, particularly in retail, and, interestingly, from Google’s investments in AI over the past year.
During the Q4 earnings call, Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, underscored the transformative impact of AI on the company’s growth across various platforms. Pichai emphasized the critical role of generative AI in improving Search. By utilizing generative AI, Search has addressed a broader spectrum of information needs and responded to novel queries with diverse perspectives. This, in turn, has significantly bolstered ad performance metrics for advertisers.
Then, on YouTube, the company continues to reap the rewards of prioritizing a creator-first economy within its platform. By offering creators unparalleled opportunities to monetize their content and establish their own businesses, YouTube has become the preferred growth channel for many creators. This has led to an influx of content, which, in turn, has led to increased viewership and, thus, growing ad revenue.
Once more, the power of AI, specifically Google’s generative AI, is pushing these capabilities to extraordinary levels. Think about this: with just a smartphone, anyone can effortlessly change their backdrop, eliminate unnecessary elements from the background, and easily translate their videos into numerous languages without a big studio budget. The success of these initiatives is evident in YouTube’s staggering numbers, with Shorts now boasting over two billion logged-in users per month and 70 billion daily views.
Google Cloud: Profits Are Snowballing
Alphabet’s Google Cloud division also posted impressive numbers, with the main highlight, for me, being its snowballing profits. Google Cloud’s unit economics continued to improve, with Q4 being the division’s fourth consecutive profitable quarter. Specifically, Google Cloud revenue growth came in at an impressive 26%, accelerating from Q3’s revenue growth of 22%, driving robust economies of scale. Consequently, the division’s operating margin surged to 9.4%. The year before, it was negative.
With Duet AI, Google Cloud’s AI-powered collaborator, the company now empowers top-tier brands such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) to supercharge developer productivity. At the same time, AI capabilities offered in the Cloud facilitate retailers like Aritzia (OTC:ATZAF) and Gymshark to understand their customers by breaking down priceless insights. As Alphabet utilizes Google Cloud to cater to each customer’s needs, I believe its momentum is set to continue for many quarters.
Record EPS & Capital Returns, Yet the Stock Remains Cheap
Alphabet’s strong revenue growth and margin expansion across the board led to the company posting record quarterly EPS of $1.66 for Q4 and a record annual EPS of $5.84 for FY2023. In turn, the company was able to afford increased capital returns to reward shareholders, with share repurchases for the year reaching a record $61.5 billion, up from $59.3 billion last year.
At its current market cap, this implies a buyback yield of 3.5%, which I find rather substantial given that Alphabet is expected to keep growing in the double digits. Specifically, consensus estimates for FY2024 point toward revenues of $342.41 billion and EPS of $6.76, suggesting year-over-year growth of 11.4% and 16.6%, respectively.
This leads us back to a crucial point I highlighted earlier in this article. Here, you have Alphabet, returning 3.5%+ per annum through buybacks, growing in the double-digits, and being at the forefront of the AI craze, Yet its stock is currently valued at just under 21 times Wall Street’s projected EPS for the year.
Notably, Alphabet is arguably the cheapest stock among the glorified “Magnificent Seven.” I’m not a fan of drawing direct comparisons among the Magnificent Seven as many investors do, given that their business models are widely different. However, this analogy highlights that Alphabet stock has not seen the same excessive investor exuberance most of the companies in this group have. Here are their forward P/Es.
Alphabet’s below-average valuation could serve as a potent catalyst for future upside, particularly in contrast to the potential valuation contractions that might affect the rest of Magnificent Seven should their earnings growth fall short of the current lofty expectations.
Is GOOGL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Regarding Wall Street’s view on the stock, Alphabet features a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 29 Buys and eight Holds assigned in the past three months. At $164.56, the average Alphabet stock price target implies 17.11% upside potential.
If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell GOOGL stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Mark Kelley from Stifel Nicolaus, boasting an average return of 28.48% per rating and a 90% success rate.

The Takeaway
Overall, Alphabet’s Q4 results, marked by accelerated revenue growth, margin expansion, and record-breaking EPS, have solidified my bullish stance on the stock.
Google’s AI-driven innovations, particularly in Search and YouTube, keep driving advertising momentum, while Google Cloud’s snowballing profitability reflects its growing significance within Alphabet’s business mix.
Despite its lively performance and growing capital returns, Alphabet appears undervalued both when assessed independently and when compared to its Magnificent Seven counterparts. This adds a layer of safety to its investment case and has also contributed to my decision to increase my position in the stock lately. Thus, Alphabet will remain a pillar tech position within my investment portfolio.","In the race for AI supremacy, investors are up in arms, trying to snatch anything that offers the potential to change the industry. With governments seeing its potential as well, it comes as no surprise that investors are flocking to stocks at the mere mention of AI in any of their announcements. Here, however, lies the problem: When everyone wants a piece of the pie, everyone gets a smaller piece.
Like in the dot-com bubble, AI stocks are getting expensive. That, and their financials are nowhere near enough to justify their inflated values. That’s why I like to forgo the noise and focus on stocks that deserve their top spots through robust financials, proven excellence or outstanding prospects. Here are three AI stocks to own at the forefront of the industry.
Nvidia (NVDA)
There’s no doubt that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the biggest winners of the AI revolution. Before that, the company was well-known for its GPUs, primarily aimed at gaming and workstation computers. Then came the cryptocurrency boom in 2020, and miners quickly emptied Nvidia GPU shelves worldwide.
When the AI boom came, the company successfully leveraged its leading position in the GPU space to develop faster, more energy-efficient GPUs and processors that matched the massive demands of generative AI systems. Thanks to the explosion in generative AI apps, its data center business has become its biggest revenue stream. Estimates of NVDA’s market share for AI data center chips range from 70% to 90%, making it the undisputed leader in the space and the primary driver for its current trillion-dollar market cap.
On February 21, NVDA released its 4th quarter earnings and showed precisely how hard it is to stop a snowball once it starts rolling. Revenue got a massive 265% bump year-over-year (YoY), ending at $22.1 billion. Net income reached $12.28 billion, up nearly 33% from Q3. The company’s data center segment continues to be its primary growth driver. This quarter, it came in at $18.40 billion, representing a 409% growth rate YoY. Gaming also saw a 56% increase YoY, primarily driven by its RTX line. NVDA continues to impress with its growing results, further cementing its place as a market leader and one of the best AI stocks to own.
Microsoft (MSFT)
The maker of the Windows operating system, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), has come a long way from being a software developer. It has grown from a software provider to a technology giant that caters to consumers, businesses and enterprises with its wide suite of productivity, personal computing and intelligent cloud services.
While its position in tech is undeniable, MSFT’s biggest and most recent success story is betting on OpenAI in 2019. By investing $1 billion, MSFT secured an exclusive partnership with the ChatGPT creator. Microsoft is now entitled to a share of OpenAI’s profits and rights to integrate the AI system into its products, among other perks, but without direct operational control.
Its latest financials showcased a strong reception for its services that support the growing AI trend. Microsoft Cloud’s revenue hit $33.7 billion, up 24% YoY. Its dynamics products and cloud services revenue also rose by 21%, and its Intelligent Cloud segment, server products and cloud services revenues increased by 22%, driven by Azure and other cloud services. In addition, total revenue reached $62.0 billion, an 18% YoY growth.
These outstanding numbers show that MSFT is on the right track. Its CEO, Satya Nadella, highlighted that the company’s transition from discussing AI to implementing AI at scale has attracted new customers and improved productivity across various sectors. So, if you’re ready to jump onto the AI train, MSFT has one more seat just for you.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)
A company that came from humble beginnings, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), more popularly known as Google, has grown from one of the most used search engines into a diversified industry giant. It offers various products and services like Android Ads, Google Maps and YouTube.
Google’s entry into the generative AI space, Gemini (previously known as Bard), is seen as one of the closest rivals to ChatGPT. GOOGL is at the forefront of the technical revolution and is making waves with AI integration in its products and other services like Google Cloud, which offers analytics and AI infrastructure.
The company’s consolidated revenue is up 13% YoY, reaching $86.31 billion in Q4. Meanwhile, full-year revenue reached $307.4 billion for 2023. Google Cloud paid off for the company, as it showed promising expansion by reaching $9.19 billion in quarterly revenue compared to its previous year’s $7.31 billion. Capping off this great quarter was a 51.84% jump in net income from $13.62 billion to $20.69 billion.
CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the company’s promising growth and investments into AI and innovation, touting that the company is starting the “Gemini era.” The promise of brighter horizons for Google makes for a compelling reason to consider it one of the top AI stocks to own.
