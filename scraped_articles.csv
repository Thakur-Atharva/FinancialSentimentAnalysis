META,,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" is a prestigious group of technology stocks with a combined market capitalization of $13.3 trillion. These seven stocks delivered blockbuster gains in 2023 and were responsible for most of the upside in the benchmark S&P 500 index because of their sheer size.
The companies that make up the Magnificent Seven are:
- Nvidia (NVDA -0.98%)
- Meta Platforms (META 0.49%)
- Microsoft (MSFT -0.08%)
- Alphabet (Google) (GOOGL -1.55%) (GOOG -1.43%)
- Apple
- Amazon
- Tesla
A case can be made for owning a slice of all seven companies. However, some of the shine has come off the group as a whole in the early stages of 2024, particularly because Tesla stock has plunged 22% for the year already. Apple is also in the red so far. On the other hand, Amazon is having a great 2024 with an impressive 16% gain to date, although it has yet to reclaim its all-time high from 2021.
The other four stocks in the Magnificent Seven -- Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- have each set a new record high this year. Momentum is a powerful thing in the stock market, and each of these four companies is underpinned by unique fundamental drivers that could lead to more gains going forward.
Here's why it's not too late to buy these four Magnificent Seven stocks.
1. Nvidia
Nvidia designed a series of data center chips capable of processing artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, and they have led to a staggering amount of revenue growth, the magnitude of which the average investor may never see again in their lifetime. It's the reason Nvidia stock surged 236% in 2023, and it has already logged a further 63% gain in 2024.
Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) is currently the industry leader, but the company is about to ramp up shipments of its new H200 GPU. It can inference (ingest live data to make predictions) at twice the speed of the H100, and it also consumes half the energy, so it will be far cheaper for data center operators to run. It's expected that existing Nvidia customers like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms will race to get their hands on as many H200 GPUs as possible.
Nvidia just reported its financial results for fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28). Its data center revenue surged by 217% year over year to $47.5 billion, which carried its total revenue to a record $60.9 billion. The company's earnings per share (profit) also exploded higher by 288% to $12.96.
Those growth rates are the reason Nvidia stock isn't necessarily expensive right now, even though it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 60.8, which is almost twice the 34.1 P/E of the Nasdaq-100 index. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to come in at $22.09 in fiscal 2025, which would shrink its P/E to a more palatable 35.6.
The stock will probably also deserve a premium to the broader market by then based on the company's growth, which alone paves the way for more upside. In short, it's unlikely Nvidia stock has finished delivering gains.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms is the parent company of social networks Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which serve more than 3.1 billion people every single day. Its stock price is up 40% in 2024, and it has logged multiple all-time highs along the way. Meta is investing heavily in AI on a few different fronts, and the company has become one of Nvidia's largest customers.
Meta developed an open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama. LLMs are the foundation models that power AI software applications -- for example, OpenAI's GPT-4 LLMs power its ChatGPT platform. Llama is open source, unlike most other LLMs, which means it receives scrutiny from thousands of AI developers, who provide valuable feedback to Meta.
In other words, the open-source approach can accelerate the advancement of Llama for everyone, but especially Meta, which will use Llama to deliver a number of different AI applications. The company recently announced it will purchase 350,000 of Nvidia's H100 GPUs by the end of 2024, worth an estimated $9 billion. They will help Meta churn out new versions of its LLM more quickly. Llama 3 is currently in training, and will soon supersede the current Llama 2 model.
But AI is also helping Meta feed more relevant content to users on its social networks. AI curates 20% to 40% of the content users see on Facebook and Instagram, which drove an uptick in the amount of time they spent on those platforms last year. That creates more opportunities to serve users with ads, which leads to more revenue for Meta.
Like Nvidia, Meta stock remains relatively cheap despite trading at an all-time high. Its P/E ratio stands at 32.5 as of this writing, which is already a small discount to the 34.1 P/E ratio of Nasdaq-100 index. Wall Street expects Meta to deliver earnings growth of 23% in 2024, so the stock will soon look even cheaper.
3. Microsoft
Microsoft was one of the early movers when the AI frenzy kicked in at the start of 2023. All eyes were on OpenAI and its ChatGPT chatbot, and Microsoft swooped in with a $13 billion investment into that start-up, which laid the foundation for many of its AI initiatives. Microsoft stock is up 10% so far in 2024, though it's down fractionally from the record high it set in early February.
Microsoft has embedded AI into its entire product portfolio, including the Bing search engine and Edge internet browser. Its Copilot AI virtual assistant is also available to users of the 365 document suite (which includes applications like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), and the Microsoft Power platform, which allows businesses to build websites and software without writing code.
The monetization opportunity is enormous. Microsoft says it has 400 million paid 365 users and all of them are candidates for the Copilot upgrade, which costs $30 per month. For context, the standard business 365 plan is $12.50 per month.
Microsoft's cloud platform for businesses, Azure, remains the fastest-growing piece of its entire organization. Over 53,000 businesses are accessing AI models and tools on Azure to accelerate their own development initiatives. In the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Azure's revenue grew by 30% year over year, and Microsoft attributed six percentage points of that growth to AI specifically -- that was double the contribution AI made in the prior quarter just three months earlier.
Microsoft is arguably the most diverse AI story available to investors. It could be one of the greatest beneficiaries of widespread AI adoption, and for that reason, its stock will likely march higher.
4. Alphabet (Google)
Alphabet is home to Google, YouTube, and the Waymo self-driving company, among other brands. The company was perceived to be under attack last year because of Microsoft's OpenAI investment, as investors feared the new ChatGPT-powered Bing would steal some of the 91.4% market share held by Google in the internet search industry.
Those concerns have since faded because Alphabet launched a series of its own LLMs and AI applications to compete with ChatGPT. Its latest model (called Gemini) outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models across most multimodal benchmarks. In other words, Alphabet says Gemini is better at understanding and generating text, images, videos, and computer code.
Beyond AI, the reason Alphabet stock logged an all-time high this year is because its advertising business -- led by Google Search and YouTube -- is bouncing back. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Google Search delivered a record $48 billion in revenue, marking a 12.7% year-over-year increase. It was the fastest rate of growth since mid-2022. Similarly, YouTube's quarterly ad revenue growth accelerated to 15.5%.
Like Microsoft, Alphabet is also building a formidable presence in AI in the cloud. Google Cloud has designed its own data center chips in-house to create an edge against competitors that only offer chips from Nvidia. Plus, Google Cloud offers over 130 generative AI models -- including Gemini -- which developers can use to build their own AI applications.
Alphabet stock trades at a P/E ratio of 24.8 as of this writing. By that metric, it's the cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven, which paves the way for more upside in its stock beyond its recent all-time high.","- Mark Zuckerberg is having some fun in Japan.
- Besides making and wielding a Katana, Zuckerberg also found time to dine at Japan's McDonalds.
- The Meta chief is off on his Asia tour, and plans to hit South Korea and India next.
Mark Zuckerberg is on his Asia tour and exploring Japan. And in what looks like the latest installment of the adventures of Relatable Zuck, the Meta CEO is indulging in activities that some American tourists might be all too familiar with.
The Meta chief started his trip with a Threads-worthy scenery shot of a glistening, snow-capped mountaintop.
On Sunday, the martial arts enthusiast posted photos and videos of himself learning to make and wield a katana. The curved, single-edged blade is commonly seen in Japanese pop culture and manga, and was also featured heavily in Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill.""
And while it's unclear if Zuckerberg's a big fan of The Bride, he did live out the Japanese anime fantasy of taking a few quick slashes with a big sword.
""Really special afternoon learning about making katanas with master Akihira Kokaji,"" Zuckerberg wrote on Instagram, expressing gratitude to the seasoned sword maker.
And when it came to meals, Zuckerberg turned to an American staple — McDonalds.
""Japanese McDonald's: 10/10. Give these guys a Michelin star,"" he wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
The billionaire posted photos of his fast food meal, which included two burgers, fries, chicken McNuggets, and two drinks.
Then came the not-so-relatable part of Zuckerberg's trip. He met with Meta's developers in Tokyo and sat down with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to discuss AI.
Zuckerberg's winter trip to Japan looks decidedly different from Elon Musk's summer excursion to Tokyo.
Musk dubbed the August vacation ""The Fast & The Fanciful: Tōkyō Drīft 2023"" in a post on X. Musk also uploaded videos of himself and his son X visiting the glittery, super-Instagrammable TeamLab Planets Tokyo exhibit in Odaiba.
Zuckerberg still has more of Asia to see. A spokesperson for Zuckerberg told Bloomberg that the billionaire was in Japan for a ""personal trip"" and will head to South Korea on Wednesday. The Meta boss is expected to wrap up his tour of Asia in India, where he's scheduled to attend the pre-wedding celebrations for billionaire Mukesh Ambani's youngest son.
Representatives for Zuckerberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.","Why Meta Platforms (META) is a Top Momentum Stock for the Long-Term
It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors.
Many investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.
Is This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?
Momentum investors, who live by the saying ""the trend is your friend,"" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.
Meta Platforms (META)
Meta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta’s family of products used by almost 3.96 billion people on a monthly basis as of Sep 30, 2023.
META sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), holds a Momentum Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of B. The stock is up 1.8% and up 20.1% over the past one-week and four-week period, respectively, and Meta Platforms has gained 184.2% in the last one-year period as well. Additionally, an average of 23,190,004 shares were traded over the last 20 trading sessions.
Momentum investors don't just pay attention to price changes; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. 15 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $2.39 to $19.94 per share. META boasts an average earnings surprise of 19.7%.
With strong earnings growth, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, investors should think about adding META to their portfolios.

AAPL,"Warren Buffett is known as a buy-and-hold investor. He once stated, ""When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.""
However, Buffett doesn't hold forever every stock he buys. There's a good bit of churn in Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 0.36%) (BRK.B 0.41%) portfolio. But the legendary investor has identified a handful of Berkshire's holdings that he believes are forever stocks. Buffett just revealed the eight stocks that he thinks Berkshire Hathaway will likely hold forever -- and Apple (AAPL -0.45%) wasn't one of them.
Two long-term Berkshire holdings
In his letter written to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year, Buffett discussed two long-term holdings -- American Express (AXP 0.10%) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO -0.46%). He noted that Berkshire completed building big positions in both stocks in the mid-1990s after several years of buying.
American Express and Coca-Cola have been massive winners for Buffett and Berkshire. In his letter written last year, he used them to make an important point: ""The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders.""
Buffett mentioned AmEx and Coca-Cola again in his most recent letter to Berkshire shareholders, which was released on Saturday. He emphasized the lesson from these two purchases: ""When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it.""
Another stock Buffett really likes
In his latest shareholder letter, Buffett added other stocks that he said Berkshire ""expect[s] to maintain indefinitely."" The first new addition to the list was Occidental Petroleum (OXY 0.64%).
Berkshire has been buying Occidental shares hand over fist. At the end of 2023, the conglomerate's stake in the company stood at 27.8%. It's now the sixth-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio.
Buffett stressed that Berkshire doesn't have any intention of fully acquiring Occidental or gaining control of the oil and gas producer. However, he said that ""we very much like our ownership,"" along with the option to increase Berkshire's position.
There are two things about Occidental that Buffett especially likes. First, the company has extensive oil and gas operations in the U.S. Second, Occidental is a leader in carbon capture.
Although Buffett acknowledged that the technology is still unproven, he argued that it, along with Occidental's large oil and gas holdings, ""are very much in our country's interest.""
Five birds of a feather
Buffett discussed the other five stocks that he believes Berkshire will hold practically forever as a group, rather than individually. They're the five huge Japanese trading houses:
- Itochu (ITOCF -2.18%) (ITOCY -0.95%)
- Marubeni (MARUY -0.03%)
- Mitsui (MITSF 2.27%) (MITSY -0.60%)
- Mitsubishi (MSBHF -1.23%)
- Sumitomo (SSUM.F -1.04%) (SSUM.Y -1.60%)
Berkshire currently owns stakes of roughly 9% in each of these Japanese companies. Buffett noted that the conglomerate has committed that it wouldn't increase its ownership in any of them beyond 9.9%.
What does Buffett like about these five companies? For one thing, he mentioned that each of them ""operates in a highly diversified manner somewhat similar to the way Berkshire itself is run."" He likes the Japanese companies' policies that are beneficial to shareholders, including smart stock buybacks. Buffett also stated that the investments could open the door for Berkshire to partner with the companies down the road.
What about Apple?
Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, by far. Buffett didn't list the tech giant in his list of stocks that Berkshire would hold forever. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Berkshire even trimmed its position in Apple.
Does this mean that Buffett doesn't view Apple as a forever kind of stock? I don't think so.
For one thing, it's important to remember that Buffett only focuses on a small number of specific Berkshire holdings in each shareholder letter. He didn't discuss Occidental (except for one brief mention), Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, or Sumitomo in last year's letter, even though Berkshire owned all of these stocks then.
In May 2023 at Berkshire's shareholder meeting, Buffett stated that Apple ""is a better business than any we own."" Again, all eight of the stocks that he indicated he thinks Berkshire will own indefinitely were in Berkshire's portfolio when he made that statement.
The bottom line is that we shouldn't assume that there aren't other stocks in addition to American Express, Coca-Cola, Occidental, and the five Japanese trading-house stocks that Berkshire will hold for decades to come. I'd bet that if Buffett were asked to name the full list, Apple would be on it -- and probably several other stocks, too.","Stock futures, TJX earnings, Apple Car cancelled: 3 Things

SEANA SMITH: So let's get right to it. The three things that you need to know, your roadmap for the trading day. ""Yahoo Finance's"" Josh Schafer, Jared Blikre, and Dan Howley have more.
JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Seana. Futures retreating this morning coming off Tuesday's mixed close, as investors await Thursday's crucial inflation report. The latest reading on personal consumption expenditures widely known as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge will help traders search for clues about the potential timing of a Fed interest rate cut.
Meanwhile, though, enthusiasm for the world's largest cryptocurrency is reaching a level last seen during its 2021 boom. Bitcoin breaking $60,000 putting it within striking distance of its all-time highs.
JARED BLIKRE: And retail earnings are occupying investors' attention this morning. TJ Maxx parent, TJX, posting better than expected sales in its fiscal fourth quarter with same-store sales jumping 5% thanks to those holiday deals.
The department store did however issue weaker guidance. TJX also announced its plan to repurchase approximately 2 billion to 2.5 billion of stock in fiscal 2025.
DAN HOWLEY: And Apple is reportedly pulling the plug on its plans of building electric vehicles. For the last decade, the iPhone maker was rumored to be spending billions of dollars on the project, which initially called for a fully autonomous car before being scaled back to a vehicle with advanced safety features.
The team consisted of 2,000 employees, many of whom will be moved to the iPhone maker's artificial intelligence division, according to Bloomberg.","- Apple will wind down its team working on electric cars, according to Bloomberg.
- The news signals an end to Apple's secretive effort to build a car to rival Tesla.
- Reports of Apple's ambition to build a car first surfaced in 2014.
Apple will wind down its team working on electric cars, called Special Projects Group, according to Bloomberg.
The news signals an end to Apple's secretive effort to build a car to rival Tesla. The program employed thousands of employees but never fit with Apple's core business of electronics and online services, and raised questions about where Apple would turn for the manufacturing of a vehicle.
Reports of Apple's ambition to build a car first surfaced in 2014 after the company recruited automotive engineers and other talent from auto companies. While there was little public information about Apple's plans, the company operated a program with autonomous Apple-owned cars equipped with sensors and safety drivers cruising around the San Francisco Bay Area.
Apple's Special Projects Group had several reorganizations over the years, including layoffs in 2019, when employees were moved to different parts of the company. Some Apple employees in the car division may move to a generative artificial intelligence team, according to Bloomberg.
The company has other automotive-related projects, including its infotainment CarPlay software, which Apple says is installed on 80% of new vehicles.
Apple's car project was part of an internal effort to look for technologies the company could develop with huge potential markets. Apple continues to develop health technologies, especially for the Apple Watch. And last month, the company released its first virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro.
Some of Apple's Asian rivals in smartphones have invested heavily in designing and potentially manufacturing cars. Xiaomi, a maker of Android smartphones, announced a new electric vehicle this week. Foxconn, Apple's main manufacturing partner, said last year it will build electric vehicles.
Apple and CEO Tim Cook never acknowledged the car project publicly, instead referring to it as work on ""autonomous systems."" In 2016, Cook was asked by a shareholder about the project, and teased that ""it's going to be Christmas Eve for a long time.""
As part of its silence, Apple's hasn't outlined its expenditures in the auto space. Overall, the company spent about $30 billion on research and development in 2023, a 14% increase over the prior year. Apple's R&D budget includes investments in new software and features for its existing products such as the iPhone.
Apple shares rose less than 1% on the news on Tuesday. Apple declined to comment.

International Edition","The world was quite different when Apple quietly started its electric vehicle project in 2014.
The zero-interest-rate policy (ZIRP) era was in its heyday; the iPhone 6 was fresh enough not to feel incremental to consumers, and the problems of a supply chain wrapped up in China only appeared in glimpses.
That all helped afford Apple the luxury to pursue something behind closed doors far beyond its usual remit of personal gadgets.
A decade on, however, things are looking quite different.
So much so, that a Bloomberg report said Apple was calling it quits on its highly secretive EV push known as Project Titan. Senior executives Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch reportedly broke news on Tuesday to the near-2,000 people working on the project.
Historically, Apple has had projects in the background that have never made the light of day. For instance, a tablet prototype developed in 1992 called the PenLite never made it to shelves. Neither did the AirPower, a wireless charging mat announced in 2017.
But in canceling a project that would have taken Apple into an entirely new industry, the company is signaling that it's done with side hobbies. And for good reason.
AI and mixed reality priorities
At an almost $3 trillion market capitalization, and as one of the most cash-rich companies today, it's easy to think Apple has the resources to continue plowing cash into side projects.
But in 2024, it's clear that Apple has a lot of other new areas to throw money at.
Having launched its Vision Pro mixed reality headset this month, the company has already committed itself to scaling and commercializing a technology that presents an entirely new business area.
The $3,500 goggles are not expected to be an immediate revenue driver. Still, the company will need to devote serious effort toward innovating the headset over the years, amid user complaints about its weight and comfort.
That's particularly so as competitors like Mark Zuckerberg post public teardowns of Apple's foray into mixed reality — a technology far from hitting mainstream appeal.
Apple will also be thinking hard about AI.
Following the release of ChatGPT, analysts and Apple watchers wondered when the company would share details about its work on AI as other Big Tech rivals like Meta and Google scrambled to make the technology a priority.
Earlier this month, CEO Tim Cook hinted that Apple would soon unveil its strategy on the technology after mentioning ""artificial intelligence"" for the first time since ChatGPT's launch in prepared remarks for an earnings call.
Of course, Apple is likely to have run into the difficulties of building EVs that so many before have encountered. The wheels fell off British billionaire Sir James Dyson's EV plans in 2019, for example. In an email to staff, he acknowledged that commercial viability was a way off.
AI and mixed reality are plenty to keep it busy for now.",,"As the first earnings season of 2024 comes to a close, Jim Cramer has given his assessment of the latest financial reports from the Magnificent Seven mega-cap companies, with NVIDIA Corp NVDA and Amazon.com Inc AMZN receiving special recognition.
What Happened: On Wednesday, Cramer commended Nvidia for its record revenue, which saw a 265% increase due to high demand for its AI products. He also lauded Amazon for its growing advertising and web services sector, reported CNBC.
""To me, a longer-term vision is what's required,"" Cramer said.
""Too bad make or break is all that we ever heard during earnings season.""
Nvidia was the first to receive praise from Cramer for its record revenue, which soared by 265% due to sustained high demand for its artificial intelligence products. Cramer then lauded Amazon as the “most definitive summa of all,” highlighting its thriving advertising business and expanding web services sector.
The CNBC host also praised Meta Platforms Inc. META for its robust advertising and WhatsApp business, and Microsoft Corporation MSFT for its strong cloud business. However, he remarked that Microsoft’s AI product, Co-Pilot, had received mixed reviews.

While Apple Inc. AAPL did not receive “high honors” according to Cramer, he argued that Wall Street was overly harsh. He also had mixed views on Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, praising its cloud business but critiquing its advertising sector. He gave Tesla Inc. TSLA a “gentleman’s C,” expressing uncertainty about the company’s outlook for the year.
“Overall, the seven truly did acquit themselves well,” he said.
“Some of these mega-cap companies aced their report cards, getting what I can only describe as ‘summas,’ at least in their orals, meaning the conference call.”
Why It Matters: Cramer’s assessment of the Magnificent Seven’s earnings comes after he suggested that investors should look beyond these tech stocks for potential high-yield investments. In a previous article, Cramer acknowledged the significant influence of mega-cap tech companies on the market but also pointed out other stocks that could offer substantial returns.
Earlier in the year, Cramer also made a bold prediction about one of the Magnificent Seven stocks, suggesting that Tesla might be the first to fall. He proposed that if Tesla loses its position, Eli Lilly could be a strong contender to take its place.

Video Transcript
BRAD SMITH: All Magnificent Seven companies have reported their fourth quarter results. The majority seeing upward estimates revision-- estimate revisions rather an average of over 7% for the quarter. That's according to Datatrek
Now, let's bring in ""Yahoo Finance's"" Josh Schafer for more details on this. Hey, Josh.
JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Brad. Datatrek did a great job breaking this down in their evening note last night. And I want to zoom out a little bit here and take a look at some of the other earnings revisions they had.
So we had earnings from all of the Magnificent Seven companies. And then, of course, the big question is, well, what do analysts think are now going to happen for the current quarter for the next year? And maybe even out into 2025? That's what gets priced into these stocks.
So if you take a look here, this is what's changed in earnings estimates over the last 30 days. So this is not expectations for next year, necessarily, directly, it is what has changed in the last 30 days.
You see, really, I think the takeaway here, Seana, you're looking at it. There's only three companies that really saw big changes. And that to me is one of the prevailing takeaways here. NVIDIA Amazon, Meta, the big three winners of this earnings season.
You can see Alphabet actually had its estimates up a little bit. But we were talking about this off air and discussing what do we learn from this. And I think it's the three companies there. And then if you look at year-to-date performance in these stocks, you probably have to give Microsoft a little bit of credit.
Microsoft is up about 8%. So a little bit over the market. So maybe we'll call it 3 and 1/2. But to me, the prevailing takeaway that we've seen in earnings projections, movements is maybe we're not talking about the Magnificent Seven.
Maybe, it's the Fantastic Four or the 3 and 1/2. I don't know. But it seems like we're no longer in this seven tech stock phase. And it's certainly narrowed.
BRAD SMITH: The triple threat. Yeah.
SEANA SMITH: Triple threat. That was a good one. OK. I was trying to I was sitting over here trying to come up with something quick. You beat me to it.
But, Josh, I think also for investors is what this means for the broader market. Zooming out even more, talking about how this is factoring into S&P projections for year end. We've seen a number of analysts, even this week with Barclays out this morning, upping their target even more.
JOSH SCHAFER: And in most of these strategists that are coming out and saying they expect the S&P 500 to rise higher, so Barclays coming out and saying that they think it's going to go to 5,300.
They're boosting their target from 4,800. The main driver of that is big tech. So they're saying they think the economy is going to hold up well, which is, of course, important, because, big tech also needs the economy to do well.
But then they're also highlighting that they think that big tech is going to be the big outperformer here. And they said in this release here in their research, they were highlighting, overall, how much more big tech is worth in the earnings story than the rest of the S&P 500, and really, the rest of big tech.
If you were to remove big tech, I'm looking at their projections for the full year 2024 right now. You're talking about the rest of the S&P 500 being at like $177 worth of earnings. Instead of when you add in big tech you get $46 worth of earnings in that. So it's a significant increase when you're adding in big tech and adding in those high expectations.
That's what's driving these targets higher right now.
SEANA SMITH: It seems like nothing stopping-- what is it? Triple threat--

“What the heck is happening?” That’s what I said to myself as I played virtual DJ, spinning two records in front of me with a cross-fade knob and special effects I could control with my hands in mid-air. I just reached out and touched them.
I had a similar WTF moment — in a good way — when I just looked at my MacBook to connect and supersize its display on the wall in front of me. Then I pinned the Apple Music app to the left of my desk and Slack to the right. This is what Apple means by spatial computing.
And I was left almost speechless when I viewed a 3D spatial video of my three dogs coming towards the camera. It’s so immersive you may get a bit emotional. Oh, and you can watch regular 3D movies in Apple TV+ that blow away your local theater.

The Apple Vision Pro is an incredible piece of technology, with eye and hand tracking interface that puts the competition to shame. But there’s some early bugs and some very weird things that come along with this revolution, including a freaky digital Persona version of yourself that can appear in FaceTime calls.
Starting at $3,500, the Vision Pro is obscenely expensive and for well-heeled early adopters only. But it is the most innovative product Apple has created in over a decade and a fascinating look at the future of computing and entertainment rolled into one very sleek package. Here’s what it’s like to use and my pros and cons so far.
Apple Vision Pro review cheat sheet

Apple Vision Pro review: Release date, price and accessories
The Apple Vision Pro is available for pre-order now and the release date is February 2.
This headset may be able to track your eyes with amazing precision, but it also starts at an eye-watering price of $3,499. The entry-level model comes with 256GB of storage, and it’s $3,699 for 512GB and $3,899 for 1TB.
Wear glasses? The ZEISS optical inserts for readers cost $99 and prescription lenses cost $149, though I do like how easily they magnetically attach to the Vision Pro. Apple Care+ will run you an additional $499, which gives you 2 years of unlimited repairs and damage protection.
In terms of accessories, there’s plenty of options, but the one I recommend most is the $199 travel case, which is big and bulky but will protect the Vision Pro when you’re flying or just going to and from the office. Other accessories include Belkin’s battery holder for $49.

Apple Vision Pro review: What’s in the box?
The Apple Vision Pro comes in a pretty big box, and there’s lots of stuff in it, including the headset itself, the Light Seal fitted for your face, the Light Seal Cushion and both the Solo Knit Band and Dual Loop Band.
There’s also the Apple Vision Pro battery, which remains tethered to the headset at all time, a second thicker Light Seal Cushion, a polishing cloth and a 30W USB-C power adapter.
Apple Vision Pro review: Design and comfort
The Apple Vision Pro is easily the sleekest headset yet, with a curved glass front panel and a modular design that makes it very customizable to the wearer. But it’s definitely not light. After 30 minutes I felt it weighing on my cheeks.
When ordering your Vision Pro, you’ll scan your face (similar to how you’d set up Face ID) to get a Light Seal that’s personalized, which prevents light from leaking into your view.
There are two bands that come with the Vision Pro. There’s the Solo Knit Band and the Dual Loop band. The former is stretchy and makes it really easy to take the Vision Pro on and off, and you can quickly tighten and loosen the fit with the built-in knob.
The Dual Loop Band provides more stability because there’s a strap that goes across the top of your head and the back. I find this one better for longer Vision Pro sessions as there’s more support for what’s a pretty weighty headset.
The Vision Pro weighs 1.3 to 1.4 pounds (depending on the Light Seal and head band configuration), which is more than an 11-inch iPad Pro on your head. For context, the Meta Quest 3 weighs 1.1 pounds and the Meta Quest Pro 1.6 pounds.
After wearing the Vision Pro on and off for several hours, I didn’t find it uncomfortable to wear, but I did feel like taking periodic breaks because of the heft. I also got some light red marks on my cheeks.
The right side of the Vision Pro houses the digital crown, which brings up the home screen from wherever you are. Turning the crown dials up the immersion on whatever Environment you’re watching (more on that later) and also controls the volume. The button on the left side of the headset is a top button, which you can use for capturing spatial photos and videos, as well as confirming purchases.
I really like how modular the Vision Pro design is. The Light Seal and and Light Seal Cushion attach magnetically to the device, and it’s easy to swap out the two band options by pulling on little orange tags. But I’d say the magnetic connection could be a bit stronger; a couple times when picking up the Vision Pro, the Light Seal detached. So you’re better off holding it by the metal and glass frame.
Apple Vision Pro review: Interface, hand and eye tracking
The Apple Vision Pro feels revolutionary because of how easy it is to operate. There’s no controllers to deal with. You just use your eyes to look at the element you want to select and then tap your thumb and index finger together to “click.”
While setting up the Vision Pro I immediately got accustomed to the input because you’re walked through a calibration process that involves following a dot around the screen and selecting it. Then you’re greeted with a home screen of iOS-like icons that float in front of your view of the room you’re in.
Vision OS starts with your real-world view as the baseline because the Vision Pro wants to bring digital content to your environment instead of taking it over. And the video pass-through is very life-like, as the dedicated R1 chip is fast enough to stream images to the Vision Pro’s microOLED displays within 12 milliseconds — that’s 8x faster than you blink.
I had no problem walking from room to room or using my iPhone with the Vision Pro on, though the frame rate of my iPhone 14 Pro Max was a tad sluggish.
As you stare around the home screen view and move your eyes from icon to icon, they light up ready to be selected. This is immensely satisfying, relaxing and easy to do, because the Vision Pro has downward-facing cameras that can track your hands in your lap.
The eye tracking is so good it’s also used to authenticate you via OpticID, which measures your pupils for security. So think Face ID for your eyes. When it works, it works well, but a couple of times during my testing it didn’t work, and sometimes you need to enter your PIN code via a floating keypad to enable OpticID, which I found annoying.
So what about gestures? You can easily scroll from left to right and up to down by pinching your fingers together and drag the direction you want to move. Zooming in on a photo or webpage is as easy as pinching your fingers together with both hands and spreading them apart. It’s Minority Report-cool.
In case you're wondering, I tried the Vision Pro in complete darkness, and you'll get warning that says you won't see your hands. But the hand- and eye-tracking interface still works, so you can definitely watch movies in bed.
Apple Vision Pro review: Spatial computing and work
So what can you do with the Vision Pro? For starters, it’s a multitasking champ, thanks to the built-in M2 chip that runs the OS. For example, I launched Safari in the center of my space, then I turned to my left and asked Siri to launch Slack and the app appeared. Then I turned to the right of Safari and opened Apple Music so I could have that playing in the background.
Even better, it’s easy to move apps around in your virtual space by selecting the bar beneath the app, and you can resize them by staring at the bottom right corner and dragging it with your finger. If you want to close an app, you can either stare at the X beneath the window or simply ask Siri to close all apps. You can also go back home at any time by long pressing the digital crown.
At any time you can pull up the Control Center by simply looking up and clicking on the floating downward-facing arrow. From this menu you can change Environments, turn on Guest mode, access Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, start screen recording and more.
One of the options in Control Center is the ability to connect with your Mac, but you can also bring your Mac desktop into the Vision Pro just by looking at it. I saw a Connect button floating above my MacBook Pro 14-inch, pinched my fingers together and saw my laptop’s screen go blank, popping up on the wall in front of me instead.
You don’t get multiple desktop views, but you do get a crystal clear 4K display that renders text crisply, and you can make that canvas positively huge so it dwarfs most of the best monitors. Your keyboard and mouse still work as they normally would with no latency. You can even use your keyboard in Vision Pro apps if you want. Yes, only Apple could do this, and I could see myself taking the Vision Pro on business trips and using it back at the hotel.
Apple Vision Pro review: Environments
One of the unique aspects of the Apple Vision Pro is your choice of multiple Environments. Think of them as 3D desktops on steroids. There are several options available, ranging from Yosemite and Haleakalā to the Moon.
I pulled up Mount Hood and was floored by the level of realism, with detailed sand and rocks beneath my feet, rippling water in front of me and a towering mountain in the background. And you get to decide how immersive the Environment is by turning the digital crown clockwise (more) or counterclockwise (less).
There are also Environments that are unique to specific apps. For instance, Apple TV+ has its own cinema Environment for watching movies that makes it feel like you’re watching a 100-foot screen, while Disney+ lets you use The Avengers Tower as your backdrop — complete with a collection of Iron Man suits — before playing a show or movie.
Apple Vision Pro review: Typing and voice input
The Apple Vision Pro lets you type on a floating keyboard to enter text, but it’s not very satisfying. For one, there’s no tactile feedback, even though you hear clicks as you type. And you can’t type very quickly; it’s more a peck-peck-peck scenario with one or two hands.
I do like that you can enter text with your voice. For example, if you’re in Safari and you just stare at the microphone icon in the address bar and speak “tomsguide.com” it will automatically take you to that website.
Also keep in mind that you can easily pair a Bluetooth keyboard to the Apple Vision Pro for easier and faster text input.
Apple Vision Pro review: 3D movies, Immersive Video and audio
The Apple Vision Pro on day one is already a first-class entertainment device, and it will make even the biggest skeptic a believer in 3D movies.
There are hundreds of 3D movies available in Apple TV+, and I couldn’t believe how good “Man of Steel” looked through the Vision Pro. As Superman took off for the first time, it was like he flew right over my shoulder.
The more recent “The Super Mario Bros.” movie was even more immersive, with the characters popping off the screen as Mario flew around in his raccoon suit while being chased by an oversized bomb.
This is a good time to mention that the sound from the Apple Vision Pro is surprisingly good. There are two audio pods built into the strap positioned close to your ears, and they deliver rich and balanced Spatial Audio. For example, I could hear Mario coming from the left side of the screen and Princess Peach from the right as they spoke.
When listening to SZA’s “Kill Bill” through Apple Music, the audio pods had plenty of punch in the drums and the vocals were crystal clear. However, it’s worth noting that the audio will leak out from the Vision Pro when listening so if you want to keep things private you should wear AirPods. The AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C is your best bet because they support lossless audio.
If you want to take entertainment to the next level, there’s Immersive Video, a new format that delivers a 3D experience via 8K recordings with a 180-degree field of view. For example, I nearly lost my breath when I watched a female highliner attempt to essentially walk a tightrope between two mountains 3,000 feet above the Earth in Norway.
As she narrated her thought process, I was mesmerized by the surrounding landscape, veins popping out of her feet as she walked barefoot across the chasm and the intensity in her blue eyes. In another Immersive Video starring Alicia Keys, I felt like I was right in the studio with her as she rehearsed, and I could see her backup singers as I peered over to the right and the instruments and speakers on the left.
Apple has shown other examples of how Immersive Video could come to life, such as through a goalie’s perspective during a soccer match, and I could see this as a game changing format for watching sporting events, especially since Apple has rights to broadcast MLB and MLS games. You could essentially sit anywhere you want to see the action.
Apple Vision Pro review: Photos and Spatial Video
One of the biggest selling points of the Apple Vision Pro is spatial photos and videos. You can take 3D stills and videos using the headset itself or capture spatial videos with the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max (not photos).
I took a spatial video of my three dogs at home in our sunroom and each pup looked incredibly life-like as they got closer to the camera and my golden retriever showed me his Christmas stocking chew toy. You’ll get the best results if your subjects are moving and you stay fairly still, as I lost the immersive effect when I turned my head to follow them around.
To take a spatial video with the Vision Pro, you use the top button on the left side of the headset, but I felt pretty geeky while doing it. You will be made fun of by family and friends — guaranteed.
The Vision Pro also brings panoramic photos to life in a new way by wrapping them around you. So it’s as if you’re standing in the center of the frame. For example, I took a panorama of the Manhattan skyline from the balcony of a Bronx apartment building, and I was completely immersed in the photo, from the Coca-Cola truck on the left side of the frame to the bridge in the center and the tall skyscrapers peaking through the cloudy background.
If you own a Vision Pro, you’ll be inspired to take more panoramic photos. But even regular photos take on new life in the Vision Pro as you scroll through your gallery. I had a blast reliving pics I took on a trip with my son to see the Buffalo Bills game and Niagara falls. His smile at the game is priceless when I see it this big.
Apple Vision Pro review: Apps
The Apple Vision Pro can run over a million compatible iPhone and iPad apps at launch, which is nice, but I was more interested in testing the truly native Vision Pro apps. While the selection is fairly modest for now — Apple says there's 600 native Vision Pro apps so far — some of the experiences are mind-blowing. Other Vision Pro apps seem more like tech demos than full-blown apps.
The most impressive Vision Pro app I tried is djay, which puts you right in front of a mixer and turntables. I had no idea what I was doing but was still blown away with the realism of the table itself and the fact that I could interact with all the buttons, sliders and needles as if they were there. And there’s wild transparent boxes that you can put your hand through to make special effects. This is nuts.
SkyGuide is a very immersive app that puts you inside a planetarium wherever you are. As you look up at the night sky you can make out constellations and also use a laser pointer to draw in the sky. This is an app that made my teenage son go “woah,” so you know it’s good.
Other notable Vision Pro apps I tried include JigSpace, which lets you place 3D animations and models right in front of you, from an airplane engine to a Formula One race car, complete with realistic light reflections. And Voyager by ForeFlight makes you feel like an air traffic controller as you watch real-time 3D visuals of planes taking off and landing at various airports. Other apps were less impressive, such as Carrot Weather.
While it’s a short experience, the Encounter Dinosaurs app from Apple is a heart-stopping example of what’s possible with the Vision Pro. A butterfly literally flies and lands on top of your finger before a giant dinosaur enters the frame, sees that you’re looking at it and then jumps out of the screen so that his nose is inches from your face. It’s scary and thrilling.
It’s very noteworthy what apps are not here at launch for the Vision Pro, such as Netflix and YouTube. There’s not even iPad-compatible apps right now. When asked about snubbing the Vision Pro, Netflix’s CEO said that they’re in discussions with Apple but right now the device is “so subscale that it’s not particularly relevant.” Yikes.
Other developers are stepping up with impressive apps, though. TikTok is a streamlined, simple and very immersive app. There's a video player front and center and you can easily pull up comments, though I'd like to see spatial video support added.

Apple Vision Pro review: Games
Does the Vision Pro have killer games? Not that I can see, but there’s a pretty good mix of native games you can control with your hands and iPad apps you can supersize and play with a controller. Jetpack Joyride is easy to control. You just press your fingers together to boost the jetpack and move your hand to fly the character.
Synthriders is way more ambitious, which is also available on Meta Quest. You use your hands to touch colorful floating balls and beams of light coming at you to the beat of a song, and you can also dodge and duck obstacles. It’s a fantastic example of mixed reality done right.
I also played What the Golf?, which is a casual mini golf game where you can place the virtual course anywhere in the room and start putting. To hit the ball you put your fingers around it and pull back and you’ll see an arrow that you can then direct with your hand. Let it go and you’ll see your ball head towards the pin. Trying to select the ball didn’t always work the first time, but I loved that I could walk around the course to get a different vantage point and the view never stuttered.
In addition, I tried a few iPad games with a connected controller on the Vision Pro, such as SonicDreamTeam. The action and graphics were smooth, but it’s essentially a 2D experience on a very large screen. You can also play Mac games through the Vision Pro, such as Resident Evil Village — if you have a powerful enough MacBook.
Personally, I’d like to see more native Vision Pro games that take advantage of your hands, such as fighting games and first-person shooters. For example, the Meta Quest 3 has a great sword fighting game called Broken Edge. Gaming is one area where Apple needs to catch up.
Apple Vision Pro review: EyeSight and Persona
Apple doesn’t want people to be closed off from the rest of the world while using the Vision Pro, so they’ve developed a few technologies to keep you at least somewhat connected.
The first innovation is EyeSight, which allows others to see a digital version of your eyes when they try to engage you while you’re wearing Vision Pro. So while you’re watching content and they walk into the room they might see a shimmer of light on the front display, but as they get closer and start to chat with you you’ll see the person break through into your view and they’ll see your eyes. It’s a subtle effect and a bit creepy looking, but it’s effective. Still, there’s no substitute for, you know, briefly taking off the headset.
The much more controversial feature is Persona, which is in beta and on the surface feels very metavers-y and un-Apple. But it started to grow on me (a little) once I started making FaceTime calls with it.
Persona is a 3D avatar of you that you create by scanning your face with the front cameras of the Vision Pro. You’ll be guided through the process step by step, which includes holding the headset in front of you, turning your face side to side and up and down, as well as smiling, raising your eyebrows and closing your eyes.
From there, the Vision Pro builds your Persona in less than a minute, and the result is impressive from a technical standpoint but also quite Uncanny Valley and conjures images of Madden or NBA 2K. It’s like me, but not quite me.
Also, I like to think I’m not too vain, but the Vision Pro managed to amplify the wrinkles on my forehead. In fact, my wife said my Persona looked like I was put through an aging filter. The good news is that if you don’t like how you look you can always recapture your Persona. You can also tweak your Persona by adjusting the color tone of your skin and the brightness, and you can choose from multiple Portrait-like effects. Contour, for example, is the most flattering.
You can also accessorize your Persona using digital glasses, but that’s about it. You can’t add things like jewelry or different clothes, etc. I’d like to see more customization options. And I wouldn't' mind if Apple took longer to process your Persona and also scanned (with your permission) some of your selfies to get the best possible result.
As part of visionOS 1.1, Apple is offering appearance updates for the Persona, so you should look a little more like yourself.
Once in a video call, you can share your Vision Pro view and any apps you’re working in, which is great for collaboration. So Apple deserves kudos for that.
Apple Vision Pro review: Performance
The Apple Vision Pro packs plenty of power between its M2 chip for overall performance and the R1 chip for processing input from the camera, sensors and microphones. Overall, I found the Vision Pro to be quite responsive and fluid, whether I was pinning multiple apps in my space, watching 3D movies or playing intense games. The Vision Pro also remained cool to the touch.
However, I did encounter some bugs at times with the Vision Pro. For example, during one session the headset refused to open the Photos app I was staring at and clicking on. Taking the headset off and putting it back on fixed the problem.
On another occasion Siri refused to open some apps like Slack and Apple Music while opening others. It wasn’t a consistent issue but was still annoying. During another session the Vision Pro wouldn’t accept my OpticID to sign in, though I do like the headset will guide you to place it further down on your head if you’re off center.
Apple Vision Pro review: Battery
The aluminum battery on the Vision Pro always needs to be with you to use the headset, which is not great. So you’ll need to put it in your pocket while standing or next to you while sitting. It’s 12.4 ounces, which is heavier than an iPhone 15 Pro Max (7.8 ounces). And while the cord is long enough most of the time, if you’re really immersed in a game or other experience and you move suddenly you could accidentally tug the battery off a table or couch onto the floor.
I’m also not a fan of how the cord to the battery can sometimes get a bit tangled. A couple of times I had to disconnect the cable so it would straighten out.
As for endurance, the Vision Pro’s battery is rated for 2 hours of general use and 2.5 hours of video playback. In my testing of on and off use over 2 hours, the Vision Pro was down to about 60% and then down to 40% after another couple hours.
If you want to use the Vision Pro continuously, you can always just plug in the battery using the included USB-C power adapter. Competing mixed reality headsets like the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest Pro have batteries built into the headset, which is more convenient, but they’re also less powerful.
Apple Vision Pro review updates
- Feb 7: The Apple Vision Pro visionOS 1.1 beta brings ""appearance updates"" to your Persona, as well as the ability to reset the Vision Pro on the device itself instead of needing to send it back to Apple.
- Feb 6: An Apple Vision Pro durability test by JerryRigEverything has found that the front panel is highly susceptible to scratches, so you'll want to make sure to use the cover and carrying case. In addition, YouTube says that a dedicated Vision Pro app is in development.
- Feb 21: The Apple Vision Pro now has a TikTok app, which we found impressive during our hands-on time.
Apple Vision Pro review: Verdict
The Apple Vision Pro is easy to scoff at because of its price. And I definitely can’t afford one at $3,500. But now that I’ve been wearing one and testing all its features, I would argue that it’s the most innovative Apple product since the original iPhone.
There’s an insane amount of ingenuity on display here, from the razor-sharp microOLED displays and the super-realistic video pass-through to the remarkably intuitive and fun interface that tracks your eyes and hands. I’m also very impressed with the spatial computing experience, as it takes multitasking to the next level, especially when you add a Mac to the mix.
In terms of entertainment, the 3D video experience on the Vision Pro is unmatched, and Immersive Video in particular has a ton of potential to change the way we view everything from concerts to sporting events. And the 3D goodness continues with moving spatial videos and photos that transform your memories into something hyper-real.
The Vision Pro app situation is clearly still in the early stages with some notable heavy hitters missing at launch. But the AR apps I tried are jaw-droppingly convincing and should hopefully spur more developers to hop on board.
So what’s not to like about the Vision Pro? The super expensive price is a big one, as it will greatly limit this headset’s initial appeal. Some may want to wait for the rumored lower-cost version on the horizon, but there’s no timetable for that. I also found the tethered battery to be annoying at times and the Personas while admirable are a bit unnerving to look at. So hopefully they look considerably better after the beta stage.
So my bottom line on the Vision Pro is that it’s definitely revolutionary, but it’s a revolution very much in progress.

That’s not always easy, though, as buying the newest MacBook isn’t always the right decision. Apple has several tiers of performance, as well as various sizes, which can further complicate the matter.
What’s more, you can also still get M1 and M2 MacBooks, some from Apple’s own website and some from third-party retailers. For instance, while the MacBook Pro has the M3 series, the MacBook Air hasn’t made the jump yet. But if you can wait for the M3 MacBook Air (which is expected early in 2024), we think you should, and we’ll explain why shortly.
So, if you’ve been considering a MacBook but don’t have a clue as to which model to buy, give our guide a read. It’ll help you narrow down your choices and come away happy with your purchase.
MacBook Air 13-inch (M2)
The MacBook for everyone
- Uses the latest Apple M2 chip
- Superthin and lightweight
- Second-lowest price for a MacBook
- Totally silent fanless design
- Larger 13.6-inch display and 500-nit brightness
- Eight-core GPU, with extra cost for 10-core
- Only passive cooling
- The screen has a notch
With a complete redesign, the 13-inch MacBook Air M2 looks a lot like the MacBook Pro, with a uniform thickness instead of the classic taper that the original MacBook Air featured. It's now thinner at the back and 0.1 pounds lighter at 2.7 pounds, despite the increased battery capacity. It uses the fanless design that sets the MacBook Air apart from other Mac laptops, yet still manages to run incredibly cool under normal workloads.
The MacBook Air M2 is a great budget option for anyone looking to update to Apple silicon or switch to a Mac for general computing on the go. It's small and light enough to disappear in a tech bag and can easily be carried around all day. The 500-nit Liquid Retina display is bright enough for most environments, an important feature for a laptop. Equally important is its long battery life, which lasts up to 18 hours during video playback with the Apple TV app. Apple includes a 30-watt USB-C charger (35-watt with the M2 10-core, 512GB storage model), but it's compatible with Apple's 67-watt USB-C power adapter.
The 2022 Apple MacBook Air also features a larger screen size. There's a thinner top bezel with a notch for the webcam, allowing the display to increase by a little over a quarter-inch to 13.6 inches diagonally. It doesn't sound like much of a change, but it is quite noticeable when the screen is open. While the slimmer bezel is welcome, the notch has been a bit controversial. Both 2023 MacBook Pro models have notches as well, so this is likely a trend that will continue.
On the topic of appearance, the MacBook Air M2 has two new color choices, Midnight and Starlight. Starlight is a pale gold tone that lacks the pink tint of the previous-generation's gold. Midnight is nearly black, which looks striking, with a hint of purplish-blue under the right lighting conditions.
The new MacBook Air M2 can be configured with up to 24GB of memory, 50% more than the older model supported, and memory is one of the best upgrades to invest in since it makes multitasking faster and more efficient.
The big news about the 2022 MacBook Air was the M2 processor, which provides up to an 18% improvement in CPU performance and 35% greater GPU performance. The GPU boost does use a bit more power, which is why the larger-capacity battery doesn't result in longer battery life than the M1 model. Overall, it's a big upgrade that makes this the best choice for a budget MacBook.
Note that the M3 chip is expected to land in the MacBook Air in early 2024, so you might want to wait for that. We've already seen it in the MacBook Pro, and it’s an even bigger improvement than the M2 was over the M1.
MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3 Max)
The MacBook Pro 14-inch gets supercharged by M3
- Space Black is the new king
- GPU performance gets big upgrade
- XDR display is even brighter
- Speakers are fantastic
- Decent webcam
- Storage and RAM is soldered on
- M3 model only supports one external display
There was a lot of hype about the M3 series of chips before they landed, and now that they’re here, we can say a huge amount of the excitement was justified. While they’re not perfect chips, they’ve given the MacBook Pro a serious performance boost.
Much of that improvement concerns graphics. In our testing, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Max chip was 13% faster in Cinebench R24’s single-core test versus the M2 Max, and 32% faster in multi-core. In HandBrake, the difference was 38%.
While that’s not completely earth-shattering, the real gains are to be found in the GPU. Here, we found the M3 Max was a step above what came before, with a 56% performance uplift over the M2 Max in Cinebench R24’s graphics test. Everything from exporting videos to 3D rendering feels snappier and more performant. If you work with graphics and need a chip that can handle whatever you throw at it, the 14-inch MacBook Pro can deliver.
That extends to gaming, too. The M3 Max is so good here, in fact, that it outperforms every RTX 4070 laptop chip we’ve reviewed. That kind of performance would have been unthinkable just a couple years ago, but now the 14-inch MacBook Pro has the hardware to be considered a gaming contender.
Once you pair that power with the dazzling mini-LED display with 120Hz refresh rate, you’ve got a gamer’s dream come true. That’s not forgetting its speakers (the best you’ll find on any laptop) and comfy keyboard, too.
While the M3 Max is the real deal, you might want to think again before buying the M3 Pro version of this MacBook Pro. Its default configuration comes with 8GB of memory, which really isn’t enough for a pro-level laptop, and its memory bandwidth has been reduced compared to the M2 Pro. Instead, it’s better to spend a little more for the M3 Max version. Get that and you’ll have the best MacBook money can buy.
MacBook Air 15-inch (M2)
A larger MacBook Air takes the laptop up a notch
- More screen!
- Excellent speakers
- Long lasting battery
- Shockingly thin
- Extra performance is welcome
- Only supports one external display
Apple has only offered the MacBook Air in one size for years, but in 2023 it switched things up by introducing a 15-inch model. It's only really for a small demographic of users -- people who want the lightness and quietness of the MacBook Air and don't need the power of the MacBook Pro -- but for those people, it's fantastic.
It retains a lot of the familiar features of the 13-inch MacBook Air, including its slimline chassis, long-lived battery and excellent speakers. If you are just looking for an ultra-portable Apple laptop, the 13-inch MacBook Air might be better suited to your needs. But if the extra screen space is more important, the 15-inch MacBook Air is a superb choice.
Unsurprisingly, its display is one of its standout features. It's bright and beautiful, with Apple's Liquid Retina display offering 500 nits of peak brightness and hitting 90% of the Adobe RGB color gamut, making it a strong performer for color-accurate work. As we said in our review, ""It’s among the best IPS laptop displays you’ll find.""
On the inside is Apple’s M2 chip, with all of its improvements over the M1 series found in the previous generation of MacBook Air. It's not going to break any records, but it's a solid performer for the money. Where the M2 chip really stands out is efficiency, where it helped the 15-inch MacBook Air last almost 19 hours in our testing. That's even more than the 18 hours Apple says you'll get.
Sure, the extra screen space means this laptop loses a little of the MacBook Air's portability. But if you're looking for a larger MacBook Air that still has almost everything you love about Apple's lightest laptops, this model is a great option.
MacBook Air 13-inch (M1)
The best budget MacBook
- Apple's M1 blows Intel away
- Phenomenal battery life
- Excellent keyboard and touchpad
- Rock-solid build quality
- Simple good looks
- Supports only one external display
Despite updating the MacBook Air to the M2 chip (and being on the brink of launching the M3 MacBook Air), Apple still sells the MacBook Air with M1 chip. The key question, then, is whether you should buy it.
The answer depends on the price you can get it for. If you can pick it up for $700 or less, you’ll be getting a superb bargain. If, however, prices are higher than that, we’d say you’re better off getting the M2 version instead.
Why is that? Well, Apple is only charging $100 more for the M2 MacBook Air compared to the M1 model. In return, you get thinner bezels, the MagSafe 3 port, a slimmer design, better speakers, a better webcam and updated wireless connectivity. That’s a lot of extra MacBook for your money.
None of that is to say the M1 MacBook Air is bad -- it’s still a good option today. Even three years after its launch, it remains a strong device, and its chip will offer plenty of power for most people. It’s so efficient, in fact, that the M1 MacBook Air doesn’t even need a fan to keep itself cool, meaning you get to work in complete silence.
So, there’s a lot to like about the M1 MacBook Air. Just wait until you find it on sale before pulling the trigger.
Frequently Asked Questions
Right now, we recommend you buy the 14-inch MacBook Pro if you need to do any heavy-duty work, plan on playing a lot of games, or simply want a device that offers more power than the standard MacBook Air. Yes, it’s more expensive, but its stunning mini-LED display, beefy M3-series chips and incredible build quality make it worth the outlay.
The M2 MacBook Air is a close second. It’s far more affordable than the M3 Max MacBook Pro, yet still offers powerful performance that will be more than enough for most people. We’d like to see it with an M3 chip, but we know that’s coming later this year. When it arrives, it might even take the top spot in our list.
The 15-inch MacBook Air and the 16-inch MacBook Pro are also worth considering, especially if you are looking for a more expansive display. In this regard, the 16-inch MacBook Pro’s mini-LED screen comes out on top, but both devices are great options.
There’s also the M1 MacBook Air to consider. While these days we recommend the M2 MacBook Air instead, it’s worth a look if you can get it for $700 or under.
As we’ve seen so far, there are plenty of fantastic MacBooks out there for you to choose from. But there’s no doubt that while Apple’s laptops offer excellent performance and features, they don’t come cheap. But don’t let that put you off getting one -- there’s another way to buy a MacBook without breaking the bank.
That’s to go for a refurbished model. Doing so can save you a huge amount of money without landing you with a dud of a computer. If you get a refurbished MacBook from a reputable outlet, you can get all that Apple goodness, like strong performance, quiet operation, and premium build quality, without any of the sticker shock.
If you decide to get a refurbished MacBook, make sure you get it from a well-regarded source that has a proven track record of happy customers. Apple has its own network of “authorized resellers” that often offer revamped laptops. Having this authorized reseller status means the company has access to genuine Apple parts, so you know that any refurbished MacBook it sells is full of high-quality parts rather than cheap knockoffs.
Apple itself often sells refurbished MacBooks, and this is the route to take if you want the best quality available. The company (obviously) uses genuine parts if anything needs to be replaced, and it then cleans up the laptop and repackages it in a brand-new box with fresh cables and accessories. You essentially get a like-new product with a reduced price tag. Refurbished MacBooks sold by Apple usually cost a little more than refreshed devices from other sellers, but in return, you get the best quality on the market. It’s also worth regularly checking Apple’s stock, as it occasionally increases the discounts it puts on these models.
Finally, you can also look on secondhand marketplaces like eBay or Back Market. There’s much less of a quality guarantee than you get when you buy from Apple or an authorized reseller, but you’ll likely be able to save more money. Be sure to check the seller’s history and reviews before making a purchase.
Simply put, no. Apple has gained everything it wants from its chips by going its own route: great power and incredible efficiency. While Intel chips can match (or outperform) Apple’s chip when it comes to power, they can’t come close to Apple’s efficiency. That means hot, noisy laptops -- the very antithesis of the current MacBook lineup.
But Apple’s switch to its own chips is important for another reason: it gives Apple control of another part of its products. Apple loves bringing things in-house and retaining control over them in this way. Now that it’s done that with its laptop chips, it’s highly unlikely it’ll ever go back to the old way of doing things.
Next on Apple’s plate is the process of following the MacBook Pro and outfitting its entire laptop range with chips from the M3 series. With the MacBook Air expected to make the leap in early 2024, Apple’s entire MacBook lineup will be on the latest generation of chips. Keep your eyes peeled for news and reviews to see which best suits your needs.

So Long, Apple Car, We’ll Never Know What We Missed
The tech giant’s decision to scrap its auto project brings everyone’s favorite Silicon Valley rumor to an anti-climatic but sadly predictable end.
What could Apple have done with the humble automobile?
Ideas, some credible and others less so, have dripped out for a decade. For a time, the company was rumored to be working on something small based on BMW’s i3. Then it was said to actually be a van. With augmented reality, a new kind of battery and smart seat belts.",,"The reviews are in, and the tech press is lauding the Apple Vision Pro headset for delivering on the company's promises. It's well-designed, the video and sound are startlingly precise, the ""Minority Report""-style gestural interface is future-tastic. Nobody's exactly sure what it's for, or whether even the Readiest Players One will spend $3,500 on it, but hey — that's gadgets for you.
Still, this is a new gadget frontier. The Vision Pro, like the similarly kitted-out Quest 3 and Quest Pro headsets from Meta, uses what's known as ""passthrough"" video — cameras and other sensors that capture imagery of the outside world and reproduce it inside the device. They feed you a synthetic environment made to look like the real one, with Apple apps and other non-real elements floating in front of it. Apple and Meta are hoping that this virtual world will be so compelling that you won't just visit. They're hoping you'll live there.
That, unfortunately, could have some very weird and very messy consequences for the human brain. Researchers have found that widespread, long-term immersion in VR headsets could literally change the way we perceive the world — and each other. ""We now have companies who are advocating that you spend many hours each day in them,"" says Jeremy Bailenson, director of the Virtual Human Interaction Lab at Stanford. ""You've got many, many people, and they're wearing it for many, many hours. And everything magnifies at scale.""
Meaning: Our brains are about to undergo a massive, society-wide experiment that could rewire our sense of the world around us, and make it even harder to agree on what constitutes reality.
The short-term side effects of virtual reality are well established. People in synthetic environments tend to misjudge distance, both at a distance and close up. That's no surprise: Even in the real, three-dimensional universe, our ability to determine how close or far away something is is subject to all kinds of external factors. Virtual environments, with their lower resolution and synthetic 3D, make all that worse — which is especially bad if you're one of those users posting videos of yourself doing things like skateboarding and driving while wearing a mixed-reality headset. You think your hands are in one place, they're actually in another, and pretty soon you're driving your Honda Civic through a supermarket.
Objects in a headset can also get funhoused. That's called object distortion — things get warped, and change size or shape or color, especially when you move your head. A video render can't compete with the processing speed and fidelity of your eyes and brain.
These are all, as the IT people say, known issues. For a few minutes or an hour, long enough to play a game or watch a movie, they're minor annoyances. But wear perception-shifting glasses for days at a time — as Bailenson's team of researchers did — and the problems get worse. Way worse.
The team wore Vision Pros and Quests around college campuses for a couple of weeks, trying to do all the things they would have done without them (with a minder nearby in case they tripped or walked into a wall). They experienced ""simulator sickness"" — nausea, headaches, dizziness. That was weird, given how experienced they all were with headsets of all kinds. And they felt all the distance and distortion effects: thinking elevator buttons were farther from their fingers, or experiencing difficulty bringing food to their mouths. But as any of us would, they adapted — their brains and muscles learned to compensate for their new view of the world.
That seems like a solution, but it ain't. When people adapt to a perceptual change for long enough, the real world starts to look wrong in the opposite direction. If you wore glasses that turned your vision upside down, let's say, you'd have to adapt again when the glasses came off. The longer you're inside a funhouse world, the longer the weird perceptual aftereffects last. So people who spend their workday inside a Vision Pro might go home at night with a miscalibrated targeting system and what feels like a shroom hangover.
Here's where the passthrough video gets uniquely important. Old-school cyberpunk envisioned virtual reality as an all-encompassing synthetic environment. New-school techies, meanwhile, proposed an augmented reality of digital pop-ups floating on see-through lenses, Google Glass-style. But both of those approaches have limits. Full, sense-isolating VR hasn't progressed much further than niche entertainment, while AR tends to make both its apps and the real world look bad. From a visual standpoint, passthrough is the least-worst solution — but its social consequences are scarier.
Because passthrough captures and then re-renders reality, it can have an unnerving, distancing effect over time. When Bailenson's colleagues actually tried to talk to people, the world turned into a giant, confusing Zoom. Video chats, as we've all experienced, are plagued by delays in responses and missed social cues. Conversations lose subtlety, but it's good enough for a meeting. But passthrough magnifies the effect — the people you talk to start to seem unreal. Up close, they look like avatars. Farther away, they become just part of the background.
Bailenson describes the feeling as one of social absence. Other people just aren't fully there. He doesn't put it this way, but I'll wave the warning flag: Long-term use of passthrough headsets could make it easier to think of other people as unhumans — non-player characters in a gamified, uncanny valley.
We all live in our own perceptual bubbles. Every person has slightly different sensory thresholds — we see colors a little bit differently, hear at different levels of acuity, are more or less sensitive to different odors. And we process all that with brains uniquely tuned first by our genes, and then by a lifetime of neural changes, of thinking and doing.
But in general, we agree on some common ground. Even if your blue looks a little different than mine, we can agree on what color the sky is. Maybe my tolerance for chili peppers is higher than yours, but we both know when we're eating them.
Headsets make the walls of those sensory bubbles even thicker, and harder to bridge. We already lack for common ground politically. Now, as millions of Americans wear VR headsets for hours at a time, we may find ourselves unable to agree on our physical reality. The headsets will put things into our visual world that aren't there for anyone else. The objects aren't objective.
And that's not all. ""These headsets can not only add things to the real world, they can also delete them,"" Bailenson says. He first realized VR's strange editing function while he was playing a game on the Quest 3 that ""knocked out"" portions of the real walls around him and replaced them with a virtual scene. ""I've been doing VR and AR for a while,"" he says, ""and I had never in my life seen deletion work so well.""
At first that seems pretty great. Stuck on a crowded bus? Delete everyone and replace them with the first-class cabin of a jumbo jet. Hate intrusive billboards? Replace all the commercial images with soothing vistas of your choosing.
But what happens when the technology gets good enough to delete, say, homeless people? Or Pride flags? You can see where I'm going here — literal erasure. When the sci-fi writer William Gibson came up with the concept of cyberspace, he described it as a ""consensual hallucination."" This is the exact opposite — billions of discrete, unshared hallucinations, each one snowflake-special.
""What we're about to experience is, using these headsets in public, common ground disappears,"" Bailenson says. ""People will be in the same physical place, experiencing simultaneous, visually different versions of the world. We're going to lose common ground.""
Stipulated: Everyone always freaks out about new consumer technology, and the freak-out is almost always the same. The new form of sensory input will harm kids! It's a dangerous distraction! It's socially alienating! They said it about the iPhone, about the Walkman … hell, half a millennium ago they said it about the book. New technologies arrive, and we adapt.
And I don't need to lean hard on my nerdiness to imagine fun sci-fi uses for passthrough. The real potential here is the ability to see the invisible informational metastructure of the world — translation overlays; pop-up tags that display people's names and pronouns and where you know them from; walking directions; user-manual-linked X-ray vision for assembling an Ikea coffee table. Link my shopping list to the aisles I need to visit in the supermarket. Maybe even expand my vision beyond what my meatbag eyes can do, and let me see into the ultraviolet, or perceive electrical fields. Passthrough has limits, but it might also have superpowers.
Like me, Bailenson isn't a freaker-outer; he loves VR, and thinks the new headsets are keen. He knows that over time, screens will get better resolution and faster rendering. New algorithms will minimize distortion. It's not the technology he's worried about. It's how much we're going to become immersed in it.
""The world's going to be just fine,"" he says. ""People adapt to media. These headsets are incredible. But philosophically, I do not believe we need to be wearing these headsets for hours every day.""
We've been here before — and very recently, at that. A decade or so ago, no one paused to consider the unintended consequences of thrusting millions of people into impossible-to-moderate social networks. And we all know how that turned out. Now, we're on the verge of sticking millions of people into helmets that give us all our own editable realities. That's why the kind of research that Bailenson is conducting on passthrough headsets is so important. ""I'm encouraging all scholars to act with some urgency to understand them,"" he says.
In the meantime, while he's doing his work, maybe don't forget to take that Vision Pro off once in a while. The longer you keep it on, the more you're turning yourself into a human guinea pig — one with really, really bad depth perception.

The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.
Top 5 Upgrades:
Deutsche Bank upgraded Southwest (LUV) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $42, up from $28. The firm believes more moderate domestic available seat mile growth for 2024 will have positive implications for domestic unit revenue performance, and by extension, should translate into solid sales performance for the domestic-focused names. As such, Deutsche upgraded Alaska (ALK), JetBlue (JBLU), and Southwest to Buy from Hold. Meanwhile, Bernstein also upgraded Southwest to Market Perform from Underperform with a price target of $32, up from $26.
UBS upgraded US Foods (USFD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $64, up from $47. Following the company's Q4 results, UBS is becoming more bullish on US Foods based on expectations for further market share gains on the back of sales force investments and its differentiated tech platform as well as higher conviction that the company's EBITDA growth trajectory is sustainable. Piper Sandler also upgraded US Foods to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $59, up from $45.
B. Riley upgraded Brunswick (BC) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $108, up from $100. The firm upgrades the shares following positive indications from the Miami International Boat Show around underlying demand trends, market share upside, increased moves to boost operating margins, and overall 2024 guidance conservatism.
Wolfe Research upgraded Freshworks (FRSH) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $27 price target. The firm sees the combination of improving fundamentals, execution, and competitive dynamics supporting multi-year 20% revenue growth with expanding margins for the company.
Mizuho upgraded LivaNova (LIVN) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $70, up from $60. The company has a ""well-hedged path"" to either 20-plus annual earnings growth over the next three years or upside optionality based on outcome of the RECOVER trial by mid-year, the firm tells investors in a research note.
Top 5 Downgrades:
Phillip Securities downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Neutral from Accumulate with an unchanged price target of $194. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade following the stock's recent gains, but says it expects Services to continue being Apple's main growth driver as its installed base increases.
Phillip Securities downgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Neutral from Accumulate with a $175 price target. The near-term outlook for Tesla ""looks quite bleak, with the company set on sacrificing margins and growth also slowing,"" the firm tells investors in a research note.
Phillip Securities downgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Neutral from Buy with a $150 price target, down from $157. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade following the recent rally and a slowdown in booking volumes for the downgrade.
Evercore ISI downgraded Caterpillar (CAT) to In Line from Outperform with a price target of $338, up from $321. The downgrade is not so much company specific as it is a call to take profits on the group, the firm tells investors in a research note.
Argus downgraded Johnson Controls (JCI) to Hold from Buy. The firm sees the stock's current valuations as reasonable given the company's reduced growth outlook due to the recent cybersecurity attack.
Top 5 Initiations:
Seaport Research initiated coverage of Booking Holdings (BKNG) with a Buy rating and $4,380 price target. The firm is positive on Booking's fundamentals saying the company is the clear leader in global online accommodations, with particular strength in Europe and Asia.
Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of BrightSpring Health (BTSG) with a Buy rating and $26 price target. The firm expects strong growth, emergence of medium-term upside drivers, acquisition execution and de-levering progress to be key drivers of the stock closing the valuation gap relative to peers. Jefferies, Wells Fargo, Leerink, BofA, UBS, and Morgan Stanley also started coverage of the name with Buy-equivalent ratings, while Deutsche Bank initiated the stock with a Hold.
Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of ArriVent Biopharma (AVBP) with a Buy rating and $27 price target. The firm anticipates clinical success of furmonertinib in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer. Citi and Jefferies also started coverage of the name with Buy-equivalent ratings.
UBS initiated coverage of Morgan Stanley Direct Lending (MSDL) with a Buy rating and $23.50 price target. Over the next 12-18 months, the firm expects the company to generate attractive returns and avoid significant credit issues, assuming the economy avoids a recession. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo started coverage of the name with Neutral-equivalent ratings, while RBC Capital initiated the stock with an Outperform.
JMP Securities initiated coverage of Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending (NCDL) with a Market Perform rating. The firm believes there could be an opportunity for valuation multiple expansion over time, but says this will likely take some time to play out, assuming strong execution. UBS and Wells Fargo also started coverage of the name with Neutral-equivalent ratings, while Truist and BofA started the stock with Buy."
TSLA,,"'Elon, what are you doing?': Joe Rogan flipped out when he saw Tesla's Optimus Gen 2 robots moving 'exactly like a person' and even gently holding eggs — 3 top robotics stocks to watch now
Comedian and podcaster Joe Rogan is no stranger to Tesla — he owns a Tesla Model S and has interviewed the company’s CEO Elon Musk multiple times. But when Rogan saw the company’s latest creation — the Optimus Gen 2 robot — he was awe-struck. And concerned.
“God damn it Elon, what are you doing?” Rogan said as he viewed Tesla’s Optimus video during a recent episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast.

“This is I, Robot,” he remarked, referencing the 2004 science fiction film starring Will Smith.
Tesla's presentation of the humanoid robot highlighted its ability to move its fingers, walk, perform squats, and delicately manipulate an egg.
Rogan expressed his fascination, noting, “Wow! This is nuts… I love the fact that it can extend its fingers, it’s moving its hands exactly like a person does.”
However, his admiration was tinged with a darker foresight.
Following the video's conclusion, which teased “Stay tuned to see what Optimus will do next,” Rogan commented, “I’ll tell you what Optimus will do next — it’s going to come out of an aircraft carrier, thousands of them, with machine guns.”
As the podcast host contemplates a future where robots dramatically change the landscape of modern warfare, investors might also want to turn their attention to the burgeoning field of robotics and automation. Wall Street already sees massive upsides in some key players in the sector.
Tesla
For the most part, Tesla (TSLA) is recognized as an electric vehicle manufacturer. However, as evidenced by Rogan’s reaction, the company is also making significant strides in the robotics arena.
In fact, Musk recently tweeted “Tesla is an AI/robotics company that appears to many to be a car company.”
Tesla's shares have experienced considerable volatility as one of the market's most dynamic mega-cap names. They doubled in value in 2023 but have seen a decline of almost 20% so far in 2024.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives sees a revival on the horizon. He has an “overweight” rating on Tesla and a price target of $315, implying a potential upside of nearly 60%.

UiPath
Founded in Bucharest, Romania, UiPath (PATH) is a robotic process automation software company. Its solutions help organizations automate their business processes.
The stock has drawn considerable attention in recent years, partly because it was one of the top holdings of Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest.
While Ark Invest has made portfolio adjustments, UiPath continues to be a prominent holding. It currently ranks as the fifth-largest holding in Wood’s flagship fund, the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK), and the third largest holding in the Ark Autonomous Technology Robotics ETF (ARKQ).
Over the last 12 months, UiPath shares have climbed 63%.
Rockwell Automation
With the rise in labor costs, an increasing number of companies are opting for automation. And that means a significant tailwind for Rockwell Automation (ROK), which focuses on industrial and warehouse automation.
The company operates through three segments: Intelligent Devices, Software and Control, and Lifecycle Services. It generated $9.1 billion in sales in fiscal 2023. In September, it bought Clearpath, a Canadian company “dedicated to automating the world’s dullest, dirtiest, and deadliest jobs.”
Rockwell also pays quarterly dividends and has been raising its payout every year.
The stock, however, has had a choppy ride and is down about 6% over the last 12 months.
Citigroup analyst Andrew Kaplowitz has a “buy” rating on Rockwell and a price target of $330 — 19% above where the stock sits today.

Don't Buy EV Stocks (Including Tesla) Until You See This was originally published by The Motley Fool","When stocks are categorized into a group and given a catchy nickname, you might say that they've arrived. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the ""Nifty 50"" were wildly popular. In the 1990s, ""The Four Horsemen"" grabbed investors' attention. A few years ago, the FAANG stocks were all the rage.
Today, we have the ""Magnificent Seven."" With such a superlative adjective in the nickname, you'd expect that these stocks have been huge winners -- and you'd be right. However, winning can come at a cost. That's literally true with these stocks: Most of them now have premium valuations.
Don't just take my word for it. New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran is widely known as the ""Dean of Valuation"" because of his expertise in valuing stocks. Damodaran recently posted on his blog, ""On every pricing metric, the Mag Seven stocks trade at a premium over the rest of the stocks in the S&P 500.""
But based on his own analysis, Damodaran doesn't think all of these seven stocks have excessive valuations. There's one ""Magnificent Seven"" stock that's not overpriced, according to the ""Dean of Valuation.""
Crossing two stocks off the list
It's not Nvidia (NVDA -1.50%).
Writing in early February, Damodaran ranked the giant chipmaker as the most expensive ""Magnificent Seven"" stock of all. At the time, he believed that Nvidia was trading nearly 56% above its fair valuation. Damodaran even posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that Nvidia ""is a bridge too far for me."" He added that he planned to reduce his position in the stock by half.
Keep in mind that this was before Nvidia announced its blowout fourth-quarter results. The stock is now nearly 19% higher than it was when Damodaran said that it was way too expensive.
The NYU professor and author also wrote that Microsoft (MSFT -0.31%) was clearly overvalued. In his blog several weeks ago, Damodaran revealed that the tech stock was trading nearly 14% above its fair valuation. Microsoft's share price has risen slightly since then.
Damodaran did acknowledge, though, that he might be too pessimistic about Nvidia's and Microsoft's growth prospects. He stated, ""I have built in substantial value from AI in my valuation of Nvidia, and given Microsoft significantly higher growth because of it, but it is plausible that I have not done enough.""
Not too far off from fair valuations
Several ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks weren't too far off from their fair valuations, in Damodaran's view. He wrote that Alphabet (GOOG -1.73%) (GOOGL -1.73%), Apple, and Amazon were ""within striking distance of value.""
At the time he wrote those words, all three of these stocks traded at less than 9% above the fair values that Damodaran calculated. Alphabet and Apple have since fallen slightly, while Amazon has risen a little.
Meta Platforms looked ""close to fairly valued,"" in Damodaran's opinion. The stock was trading at nearly 2.5% over its fair valuation based on his analysis. However, Meta's share price has jumped roughly 8% since Damodaran posted his blog.
The cheapest ""Magnificent Seven"" stock of all?
Damodaran determined that Tesla (TSLA 0.33%) was the cheapest ""Magnificent Seven"" stock of all. He even revealed that he had bought shares of Tesla in the week before his blog was published online.
Ranking Tesla as the most attractively valued ""Magnificent Seven"" stock might be surprising. The electric vehicle maker's forward earnings multiple currently tops 63x. That doesn't scream inexpensive.
However, Damodaran factors expected growth into his valuation model. He projected that Tesla will be able to increase its revenue by a compound annual growth rate of 31.1% over the next five years. When he crunched the numbers, the stock was only 0.72% above its fair value. After rising some in recent weeks, Tesla is now a little 6% over Damodaran's calculated fair value.
Because of the price changes for the seven stocks, Alphabet is now closer to Damodaran's fair value than any other ""Magnificent Seven"" stock. Importantly, the NYU professor didn't assume lofty growth for Alphabet, plugging a revenue CAGR over the next five years of only 8% into his model. This relatively low growth estimate makes his calculations less susceptible to being overly optimistic.
In my opinion, Alphabet deserves the mantle as the cheapest of the ""Magnificent Seven"" for now. I suspect that the ""Dean of Valuation"" might agree.",,"There is a sweet ending to a saga that pitted a San Jose small business owner against a Silicon Valley giant.
Business has been booming at The Giving Pies after the community learned that the owner was left holding the bag after an order for 4,000 mini pies for Tesla was abruptly canceled.
This past weekend, community members showed up by the hundreds to support the small Black- and woman-owned business.
""Oh my gosh, it's incredible,"" The Giving Pies owner Voahangy Rasetarinera said. ""I am blown away. I'm like, 'I didn’t do it for that.' I'm so grateful. It's amazing. People are amazing.""

More than 300 customers showed up to support the business on Friday and Saturday, and Rasetarinera said she received donations from across the country and from a few people as far away as the Netherlands and Sweden.
Elon Musk personally posted that Tesla would make things right with the bakery, and Tesla has. Rasetarinera said a Tesla manager offered to pay and reimburse her for the $2,000 worth of supplies that she rushed to get ready for the previous order and offered her a new catering job for 3,600 mini pies for a women’s day celebration in March.
That's a job she had to turn down.
""Unfortunately, I can not do their catering event because with all the business that we got we depleted our stock of crust, and then we also have Pi Day to prepare for, so there’s no way,"" she said with a laugh.
Rasetarinera said she is willing to work with Tesla in the future but wants to make good on the orders she already has.","- Tesla paid a bakery $2,000 after it canceled a massive Black History Month order at short notice.
- The order for 4,000 pies was abruptly canceled, leaving the Black-owned business out of pocket.
- Elon Musk said he would ""make things good"" after news reports of the incident spread online.
Tesla has settled a bill with a bakery that said it ran up $2,000 in costs for a massive order for the company, which was then canceled at short notice, The Guardian reported.
Voahangy Rasetarinera, the owner of The Giving Pies in San Jose, California, wrote on Instagram last week that Tesla had ""hurt my small Black women-owned business"" by canceling an order for 4,000 pies after she hastily bought supplies and rallied staff to meet the tight deadline requested by the company.
""To fulfill the order, I had turned down other Black History Month catering inquiries, purchased supplies, and prepared for a demanding production schedule,"" she wrote.
After the story spread, Elon Musk responded on X, writing: ""Just hearing about this. Will make things good with the bakery.""
Rasetarinera confirmed to The Guardian Monday that she had received $2,000 from Tesla.
The situation unfolded after Rasetarinera received an order for 2,000 pies on February 14 from a Tesla representative, which was quickly doubled to 4,000 the next day, she wrote on Instagram.
The order was worth $16,000, NBC Bay Area reported, though other outlets set that figure at $6,000.
Rasetarinera told ABC7 that although Tesla did not immediately pay the invoice, she proceeded anyway because she believed ""they are professional.""
However, after following up on the invoice she received a text message from the company representative saying the order would no longer be needed, she said.
While the bakery has a cancellation policy, it could not recoup its costs because Tesla had not paid the invoice, NBC Bay Area reported.
Tesla did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment, but as the story spread Rasetarinera told ABC7 that a company representative had reached out to her.
The representative said that the employee who had made the order had not been authorized to promise any payment, the outlet reported.
Rasetarinera's post garnered massive attention, gaining hundreds of comments — some supportive of her business, others defending Tesla.
According to local outlet KRON4, the small business has seen an outpouring of community support since she posted about the situation.
San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan wrote on X that when he visited the bakery on February 25 ""the line was wrapped around the block!""
Rasetarinera said in a February 2 post celebrating Black History Month that she's of Madagascan heritage.
""As I reflect on this ordeal, I am reminded of the resilience and determination that have propelled me forward as a black woman entrepreneur,"" Rasetarinera wrote in her original Instagram post.","Tesla has reportedly settled its payment to a California bakery owner who said she was stiffed out of thousands of dollars after an employee at the EV-maker cancelled an order for thousands of pies.
Voahangy Rasetarinera, the owner of Giving Pies, posted her experience working with Tesla on an Instagram post titled, “How Tesla’s Actions Hurt My Small Black Women-Owned Business.” In the post, Rasetarinera said she received an inquiry on Feb. 14 from a Tesla employee named Laura for an order of 2,000 mini pies, but “complications arose when the payment process was redirected.”
“Despite this hurdle, I remained optimistic as I awaited payment,” she said, but she “grew concerned” when she didn’t receive the payment. Rasetarinera said she heard back from Laura who apologized for not paying on time, and who requested to double the order to 4,000 pies. However, after preparing the extra order, Rasetarinera said she had still not received payment, and could not contact the Tesla employee.
“[M]y hopes were shattered when I received a text from Laura, CASUALLY informing me that the plan had changed and Tesla would no longer require the order,” Rasetarinera wrote. “This abrupt reversal left me reeling, realizing the extent of the impact on my small business. I had invested time, resources, and effort based on assurances from Tesla, only to be left high and dry.”
After her story gained media attention, Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded on X, saying, he would “make things good with the bakery.”
“People should always be able to count on Tesla trying its best,” Musk wrote.
Rasetarinera confirmed with The Guardian Monday that,“Tesla just paid the $2k that I was out of” for the cost of ingredients for the order. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Quartz.
Despite the fiasco with Tesla, Rasetarinera told ABC 7 sales at her small bakery were up after the story went viral, and she had to close the shop to catch up on orders. She also told the news outlet she would be open to working with Tesla again.
“I think that we’re all humans, we all make mistakes, and they’re trying to do good on their mistakes,” Rasetarinera said, “So if they want to work with me, and they’re not bitter about the whole experience - then yes, I would love to.”","There was a time when an electric Tesla pickup, something designed to go head-to-head against America’s most popular products, the Ford F-150 and Chevrolet Silverado, seemed just the thing to take Tesla truly mainstream.
Then, in 2019, Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Cybertruck, a bare metal box on wheels. It’s the furthest thing from mainstream. This truck has attracted ardent fans and even more ardent critics. But it has good towing and hauling capabilities even though it sacrifices some usability to its literally edgy design. For some customers, the sacrifice is undoubtably worth it.
But it may be more of a question about whether Ford and GM really need to worry.
If it’s a contest for eyeballs, they do. Even when I parked a rented Tesla Cybertruck next to a hot-pink McLaren supercar in a shopping center parking lot in California, the people in the McLaren couldn’t stop talking about the Cybertruck. Everywhere I went, the huge, shiny silver truck was a crowd magnet, drawing young people who’d been waiting to see one in real life and others, usually older, who had no idea what this thing even was.
The Tesla Cybertruck looks like nothing else on the road. And its size – it’s not quite as long as a Ford F-150 but somehow looks even bigger – is even more eye-catching. Of course, once the Cybertruck has been on the market a while, its draw will subside.
There’s a lot to like about the Cybertruck, but it also embodies a disturbing level of individual arrogance in hard, unforgiving steel. Concerns for the safety of others on the road and even the practical needs of its own users appear to have been placed second to a design and engineering directive spearheaded by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk. As Walter Isaacson’s recent biography of Musk makes clear, it was Musk’s fixation on this structure, created from the same steel SpaceX uses for rockets, that resulted in the rectilinear mass of naked metal that I was driving through the southern California hills.
A sports-truck
It was the most enjoyable electric truck I’ve driven yet. I’ve driven nearly all the other electric trucks currently on the market such as Ford’s and Rivian’s and I don’t expect any will surpass the Cybertruck in its sports-car like performance. Ordinarily, not a priority in a pickup. It’s got powerful acceleration and steering that feels quick, responsive and nimble. With its punchy acceleration, quick steering and custom-designed Goodyear truck tires, it reminded me a bit of driving the Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato, a high-performance sports car fitted with off-road tires and raised suspension. But the Cybertruck is, of course, bigger and more than twice as heavy.
Even a mildly firm press on the accelerator left everyone else quickly behind. With its drive-by-wire steering system, a slight turn of its small, rectangular steering wheel yielded tight turns at lower speeds but, at higher speeds, it wasn’t hard to keep the truck in its lane. Four-wheel steering allows it to turn around in a smaller area than one might expect.
Tesla did not provide CNN with a Cybertruck to test. Instead, we rented one for over $1,000 for the day through Turo, the peer-to-peer vehicle rental service. (Turo doesn’t set the rates, vehicle owners do, and Cybertruck rates have come down somewhat since then.) My Turo host walked me through the Cybertruck’s various very weird – by non-Tesla standards – controls.
The turn signals are controlled using steering wheel buttons rather than a stalk. (Again, this is similar to a Lamborghini or Ferrari.) To put the truck in drive or reverse, I swiped up and down on a truck icon on the center screen. (In case the screen ever goes blank, there is a row of gear selector buttons on the ceiling just above the windshield.) And I had to dig a bit on the touchscreen to find the control for the Cybertruck’s one gigantic windshield wiper. Once I’d driven the truck an hour or so, though, everything seemed logical.
Um, what’s with the rearview mirror?
It does have a windshield-mounted rear-view mirror but, troublingly, it’s entirely useless most of the time. With the bed cover closed, there is nothing to see out the back window.
Many modern SUVs have rearview mirrors that double as a video screen showing a view from a camera mounted in the back. Tesla could have used a similar system but, no. In the Cybertruck the rear video view is displayed in a small rectangle in the truck’s center screen. It’s there all the time while you drive.
This may seem like a minor detail but it says a lot about how Tesla thinks about vehicle controls. The only reason to have the rearview video display inside the rearview mirror is because that’s where drivers are used to looking. Similarly, the only reason to have a turn signal stalk is that’s what people are used to. For better or worse, Tesla does not care what you’re used to.
There are indications this attitude contributes to higher crash rates but, if Tesla were inventing a vehicle from scratch the strange choices would be totally sensible.
Then there’s the Cybertruck’s crazy shape. Other companies have been making pickup trucks for well more than a century and there are reasons they’re not usually shaped like wedges. In this case, the Cybertruck is hindered by an apparent, needless desire to be different.
Not ideal for cargo
In the Cybertruck, if you load up the cargo bed then decide you want to reach something in the front, something close to the back window, you’ll need to start unpacking. There’s no reaching over the side of the bed to get at it. The side wall is just too high.
Unlike other large trucks, the Cybertruck also gives you nowhere to put your foot to help you reach over the cargo bed’s side other than the back tire, which could be slick with mud and dirt. There’s not even much room to stand on the back bumper.
The” frunk,” or front trunk, is also a fairly useless afterthought compared to the one on in the Ford F-150 Lightning. Ford’s is just bigger, to start with, and it has loads of power outlets making it a genuinely functional workspace. The Cybertruck’s is handy as, maybe, a place to sit. There is a fair-sized storage bin, though.
For now, at least, the Cybertruck isn’t in the same price range as the Lightning, either. The Foundation Series truck I drove cost over $100,000. It will be next year before Tesla has said it will start producing trucks costing around $60,000.
Most concerning, though, is the manufacturing quality. The interior is fairly nice, if spartan, but that’s the easy part, especially since Tesla does away with most switches. The hard part is making a body from stainless steel, especially one with mostly straight edges that don’t hide misalignments.
In most cars and trucks, body panel alignments are a purely cosmetic concern. It doesn’t look good when there are big, uneven gaps between different sections of the body. But most vehicles aren’t made from thick, hard-edged stainless steel. At the front corners of our Cybertruck there were gaps big enough to see daylight through and hard edges stuck out from the body.
On the edge
I worried if this truck hit a pedestrian or if someone slipped while climbing over the bed side that the unyielding metal could cause real harm. It’s not actually knife-edged, of course, but, hitting soft flesh with enough force, it seems like it could rip through skin. I emailed Tesla to ask if the automaker had any concerns about this, but I haven’t received a response. Tesla has not responded to CNN inquiries in years.
This is not a truck that customers will buy in big numbers, and not just because Tesla isn’t making them in big numbers, yet. It’s fun and it’s interesting but, for those who just want to get the job done, there’s not much reason to buy this instead of something more normal and functional. It doesn’t seem like it will do anything – or at least anything that matters – much better than a Ford F-150 Lightning or a Chevrolet Silverado EV and it will definitely be worse in some important ways.
If you want to draw a crowd, though, this is your ride. At least while the novelty lasts.","Tesla Model 3 review
Category: Electric car
The Model 3 is well-equipped, good to drive and has a competitive range
Introduction
What Car? says...
What with owner Elon Musk’s space ambitions and X/Twitter purchase, there’s so much noise around Tesla that you could almost forget that the company makes cars. Well, it does – and its best-known model is the Tesla Model 3.
The Model 3 is a fully electric car, and is also the US brand’s smallest and cheapest model. It sits below the Tesla Model S luxury saloon, and the Tesla Model X and Model Y SUVs in the car maker's (all-electric) line-up.
It's roughly the same size as a BMW 3 Series and there are two versions to choose from: an entry-level, rear-wheel drive, and a Long Range version designed to (yep, you guessed it) maximise the range between charges.
In the ever-expanding world of electric cars, the Model 3's closest rivals are the BMW i4, BYD Seal and Polestar 2. You might also find yourself considering the Hyundai Ioniq 6 and VW ID 7, or possibly higher-riding options, such as the Genesis GV60 and Kia EV6.
So, is the Tesla Model 3 better than those rival electric cars? Read on to find out...
Performance & drive
What it’s like to drive, and how quiet it is
Engine, 0-60mph and gearbox
Even the entry-level Tesla Model 3 – called the Rear-wheel Drive (RWD) – can officially sprint from 0-60mph in a rapid 5.8 seconds. That's much quicker than the equivalent Hyundai Ioniq 6 and on par with an entry-level BMW i4 or BYD Seal.
The four-wheel-drive Long Range version benefits from two electric motors rather than one, so it's even quicker. It’ll officially accelerate from 0-60mph in just 4.2 seconds, making it just as quick as a Porsche 911 Carrera 4 and slightly faster than the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor. A VW ID 7 would be left way behind.
On standard 18in wheels, the RWD has an official range of 318 miles, rising to 390 miles for the Long Range. It's worth taking these figures with a pinch of salt, though – in our 2024 winter real range test, a Long Range running on standard 18in aero alloys covered 293 miles before running out of charge. Expect a real-world range of around 340 miles in the summer months.
Suspension and ride comfort
The ride is firmer than in an adaptive suspension-equipped ID 7, but the upside is that the Model 3 has impressive body control on undulating country roads and it never thumps or crashes over urban imperfections.
If you want the best ride possible we would suggest sticking with the 18in wheels rather than stepping up to the optional 19s because having a thicker, spongier sidewall helps to take the sting out of sharp-edged abrasions.
Handling
Compared with its rivals, the Model 3 is relatively light, and that allows it to stay remarkably upright through turns while also generating plenty of grip.
It feels even more keen to change direction than the ID 7 and the Seal, plus its steering is super-accurate – although some drivers might prefer it to have a bit more heft when turning in to a corner.
The Model 3 is not the most expressive car in the bends, with a neutral handling balance that inspires confidence but doesn't thrill. If you want something a little more playful, you might prefer the Seal.
Noise and vibration
The Model 3 is, like many electric cars, whisper-quiet at town speeds, but as speeds increase you do start to hear some wind noise from around the double-glazed but pillarless side windows.
You don’t, however, get much road or suspension noise, which makes the Model 3 a relaxing long-distance companion. Indeed, when we got our decibel meter out it showed that at motorway speeds there's nothing in it between the i4, the Seal and the Model 3. Only the pricier ID 7 is noticeably quieter.
The brakes deserve a special mention for being far less grabby than those in many electric cars. They make it easy to slow down smoothly without your passengers thinking you’ve only just passed your driving test.
Driving overview
Strengths Rapid acceleration; agile handling; great range between charges; true one-pedal driving
Weaknesses BYD Seal is more fun in the bends
Interior
The interior layout, fit and finish
Driving position and dashboard
To keep the Tesla Model 3's dashboard looking as minimalist as a Scandinavian studio apartment, everything from the door mirrors to the height and reach of the steering wheel must be adjusted using a combination of the big central touchscreen and scroll buttons on the steering wheel. It’s a frustrating process and not advisable while driving.
We also don’t like that the Model 3 doesn’t have stalks on its steering column. Instead, there are haptic buttons on the steering to control the indicators, windscreen wipers and cruise control. You do eventually get used to it, but it seems like a solution to a problem that didn't exist.
Aside from the questionable ergonomics, the Model 3's driving position is good. You sit relatively high up by executive saloon standards (although still lower than in the Polestar 2), and the seat, steering wheel and pedals line up neatly.
Visibility, parking sensors and cameras
The front windscreen pillars are exceedingly thick and angled in such a way that they can badly hamper your view out at junctions. How badly will depend on your height and your general driving position, but it's fair to say that the BYD Seal and the Polestar 2 are no better in this regard.
More positively, the view out of the back is pretty good and all versions come with front and rear parking sensors, along with a surround-view camera.
LED headlights are standard and illuminate very well, although you can't have the matrix headlights available on some executive cars, including the BMW i4 and VW ID 7, which shape their beams to avoid dazzling other drivers.
Sat nav and infotainment
The Model 3 gets a big, bright 15.4in central infotainment touchscreen that is pretty intuitive to use and quick to respond once you’ve made your selection.
There are loads of useful features (navigation, web browsing and so on), apps (such as Netflix and Spotify) and some purely fun applications (driving games controlled using the steering wheel and the ability to make whoopee cushion noises to amuse your passengers).
You also get two easily accessible wireless phone-charging mats below the infotainment screen and a couple of high-powered USB-C ports for rapid device charging. Overall, it's a better system than you'll find in the Seal and Polestar 2, if not quite as easy to use as the iDrive system in the i4.
It's a bit disappointing that no Model 3 has Android Auto or Apple CarPlay smartphone mirroring. You get a free data connection (for watching films, browsing the internet etc) for 30 days, but after that you have to sign up to a subscription or use your phone's data allowance.
Quality
The Model 3's build quality is definitely the best we’ve seen from Tesla and it's more than a match for the Seal, and roughly on a par with the pricier ID 7.
There are soft-touch materials everywhere you touch, and while the faux leather on the seats and steering wheel doesn’t feel quite as premium as the leather you can have in an i4, everything else feels tactile and pleasant.
Interior overview
Strengths Minimalist interior feels upmarket; infotainment system is quick and packed with features; plenty of parking aids come as standard
Weaknesses Windscreen pillars hamper visibility at junctions; lack of stalks can be fiddly; speedo is on the central touchscreen
Passenger & boot space
How it copes with people and clutter
Front space
No one sitting in the front of a Tesla Model 3 is going to complain about space – no matter how tall they are. There’s also loads of room for odds and ends, with a couple of lidded cubbies between the front seats, as well as front door bins that can each take a big bottle of water.
The front seat area feels remarkably light and airy, with a combination of tall side windows and a standard panoramic glass roof.
Rear space
Not only does the Model 3 have plenty of rear head and legroom, but thanks to tall side windows and a broad glass roof it also feels pleasingly airy – something you can't say about the i4. Middle rear passengers also have plenty of space for their knees and feet, with no central hump in the floor to straddle.
However, if you want a car with limo-like space in the rear, we'd point you in the direction of the VW ID 7. In that car, six-footers are able to stretch out behind a driver of a similar height, something that isn't possible in the Model 3. The ID 7's rear bench also has the best under-thigh support of any car in the class, making it comfortable on long journeys.
Seat folding and flexibility
The Model 3’s rear seatback splits in a 60/40 arrangement and can be folded down when you need to carry long loads.
Some electric rivals, including the Hyundai Ioniq 6 and the Polestar 2, have 60/40 split-folding rear seats too, but the BMW i4 and the iD 7 offer a more flexible 40/20/40 split as standard.
There are no clever features, such as sliding or reclining rear seats in the Model 3, but then there aren't in any traditional executive car rivals either.
Boot space
The Model 3 is a saloon, so its boot aperture isn’t huge. However, there’s more space for luggage than you’ll find in conventional executive rivals (the Audi A4 and the BMW 3 Series for example) as well as many electric alternatives, including the i4, BYD Seal, Ioniq 6, Polestar 2 and VW ID 7.
That’s thanks partly to a huge well under the main boot floor, but also the extra storage in the ""frunk"" under the bonnet. In total, we managed to squeeze in an impressive total of nine carry-on suitcases into the Model 3's two boots. A buggy or a couple of sets of golf clubs shouldn't prove a problem.
All versions have an electric tailgate that can be opened and closed using the touchscreen, from the Tesla app on your phone or by pressing a button on the boot lid itself.
Practicality overview
Strengths Big boot with lots of underfloor storage; good read head and leg room; plenty of storage in the front
Weaknesses Saloon boot hinders practicality; and ID 7 is even roomier in the back
Buying & owning
Everyday costs, plus how reliable and safe it is
Costs, insurance groups, MPG and CO2
The Model 3 is the least expensive car Tesla makes, and our favourite entry-level RWD version undercuts pretty much every rival, including the BMW i4, BYD Seal, Hyundai Ioniq 6, Polestar 2 and VW ID 7.
Like all pure electric cars, the Model 3 makes a huge amount of sense for company car drivers because of the enormous benefit-in-kind (BIK) tax savings on offer. Plus, if you can charge your car at home, you’ll spend less on electricity than you would on petrol or diesel.
Buying a Model 3 gives you access to Tesla’s Supercharger network and impressive maximum charging speeds (up to 170kW for the RWD and 250kW for the Long Range), allowing you to charge the battery (from 10-80%) in less than 30 minutes. You have to pay each time, but the price is reasonable, and the network is more extensive and reliable than any other. That's a big reason to buy the Model 3 over, for example, the Polestar 2.
Of course, you can still charge up at any CCS public charging point if you need to, but it will take longer. A full 0-100% charge at home using a 7kW charger takes around 12 hours in a Model 3 Long Range, and roughly nine hours in the entry-level RWD model.
Equipment, options and extras
All versions of the Model 3 come with plenty of luxuries, including climate control, adaptive cruise control, faux-leather seats (heated and ventilated in the front and heated in the rear), a heated steering wheel and keyless entry using an app on your smartphone.
Other than an upgraded stereo system with 17 speakers instead of the standard 14, there’s no equipment difference between the Long Range and the entry-level RWD. That's one of the reasons why the RWD is our recommended version.
It’s a good thing the Model 3 is so well equipped as standard, because there isn’t much on the options list. Indeed, apart from metallic paint, different alloy wheel designs and white (instead of black) seats, the only options are Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self Driving Capability.
Those last two features allow the Model 3 to make lane changes on its own (just hit the indicator), steer itself into a parking space and even be ""summoned"" with a smartphone app at very low speeds. So, if someone parks too close in a car park for you to open the doors, you can drive it out of the space using your phone.
Reliability
The Model 3 comes with a four-year/50,000-mile warranty. The battery and drive unit are covered separately for eight years and 100,000 miles on the entry-level (RWD) model, or eight years and 120,000 miles on the Long Range version. That covers the electrical bits against faults and guarantees a minimum 70% retention of battery capacity.
Tesla finished in a respectable tenth place out of 32 car makers in the 2023 What Car? Reliability Survey. Meanwhile, the pre-facelift Model 3 did quite well too, coming eighth out of 20 models in the electric car category.
Safety and security
The Model 3 is one of the safest cars ever tested by Euro NCAP – it scored exceptionally well for its ability to protect occupants in an accident and help you avoid a crash in the first place. The suite of standard safety aids includes blind-spot monitoring and automatic emergency braking (AEB).
As for security, as well as the usual kit, there’s something called Sentry mode. When enabled, it uses the car’s external cameras to start recording when the car is approached after it’s locked, saving the footage to a USB drive. If anyone tries to break in or if someone drives into your Model 3 when it's parked up, the cameras will record it.
Buying & owning overview
Strengths Attractively priced; access to Tesla Supercharger network; all versions are well equipped; excellent Euro NCAP safety score
Weaknesses Huge price jump from RWD to the Long Range model

FAQs
Tesla cut its prices in early 2023, and the Model 3 now undercuts rivals such as the Hyundai Ioniq 6 and Polestar 2. You can find out the latest prices using our New Car Deals pages.
The Model 3's battery is covered for eight years and 100,000 miles on the entry-level RWD model, or eight years and 120,000 miles on Long Range and Performance versions. During the term, Tesla guarantees a minimum 70% retention of the original battery capacity.
The Model 3 is usually more expensive to insure than rival electric cars because Thatcham has given the car a relatively high insurance group rating.
Tesla came a respectable tenth (out of 32 brands) in the 2023 What Car? Reliability Survey. The pre-facelifted Model 3 (2019-2023) did quite well too, coming eighth out of 20 models in the electric car category.

Tesla Cybertruck Review: It’s Weird. It’s Brash. It’s Not Bad.
Everything you need to know about driving Tesla’s polarizing electric pickup.
For the sake of this review, let’s suspend whatever we think of Elon Musk.
A truck this unusual deserves attention unencumbered by the distractions of its creator. The vehicle itself needs no introduction: Tesla Inc. has been collecting deposits since 2019 and started delivering the trucks in November. The company hasn’t said how many are out there, but we know that Serena Williams’ husband owns one, as does Pharrell Williams.","Elon Musk eats humble pie over unpaid bakery bill
- Published
Elon Musk has stepped in to foot the bill for 4,000 mini pies after his firm cancelled an order at the last minute.
Giving Pies bakery in San Jose was left $2,000 (£1,500) out of pocket when Tesla backed out just before delivery.
But when the small business took to social media to complain, Mr Musk said he would stump up the dough.
He even had Tesla place a new order - but the bakery said it was now so flooded with business from well-wishers it was too busy to take it on.
""It's incredible, I'm blown away,"" Voahangy Rasetarinera, the owner of the California bakery, told NBC.
""I'm so grateful, it's amazing, people are amazing.""

Her response came after Mr Musk took to social media to resolve the dispute.
""Just hearing about this,"" he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, responding to a local news story about Tesla cancelling the order.
""Will make things good with the bakery. People should always be able to count on Tesla trying its best.""
Making a crust
Ms Rasetarinera also explained why Tesla's fresh request - for 3,600 more mini pies - was one she had to turn down.
""Unfortunately, I can not do their catering event because with all the business that we got, we depleted our stock,"" she said.
The mayor of San Jose was even among those popping in for a pie - and he said queues for the bakery ""wrapped around the block"".
""It's inspiring to see our community come together to support Voahangy and her small business after a big order recently fell through,"" he said in a post on X.
""Stop by The Giving Pies the next time you're looking for a delicious dessert and help support an amazing local entrepreneur.
""And thanks to Elon Musk for making it right by paying for the pies after all!""

“Just hearing about this. Will make things good with the bakery,” Musk said on X (formerly Twitter) in response to a story about the cancelled order.
Musk’s company Tesla ditched an order for 4,000 mini pies from Giving Pies, a Black-owned bakery in San Jose, in central California.
Owner Voahangy Rasetarinera told KRON-TV that her bakery received a last-minute order for 2,000 pies from Tesla on Valentine’s Day – a $6,000 catch for the small business, KTVU reported.
While Rasetarinera has previously worked on large catering orders with other tech companies, she said that she had to chase Tesla several times about payment for the order, money needed to secure ingredients and pay her staff.
On Thursday evening, a Tesla representative named Laura contacted Rasetarinera and apologized about the delayed payment. Laura also upped the order to 4,000 pies, assuring Rasetarinera that money was not an issue.
Rasetarinera said that she and her team had worked overtime to pull off the mega order. But Tesla never responded to several invoices sent from the pie company for payment.
Instead, on Friday, Laura messaged Rasetarinera, letting her know that the order was no longer needed.
Rasetarinera said in a post to Facebook that the casual cancellation “left me reeling, realizing the extent of the impact on my small business”.
“I had invested time, resources, and effort based on assurances from Tesla, only to be left high and dry,” she added.
Rasetarinera told KRON that the last-minute canceling of such a large order hurt her business. In order to fulfill Tesla’s order, Rasetarinera had to decline other catering gigs.
“I’m a small business. I don’t have the luxury of infinite resources so I really need to be paid so I can secure my staff,” Rasetarinera said.
A representative of Tesla later reached out to Rasetarinera and said that Laura was not authorized to approve payments, KGO-TV, an ABC affiliate, reported.
As of Thursday, the company did not pay Rasetarinera for the pies but offered her a tour of the factory.
But Musk’s post on Friday, in light of the viral story, may be a sign that the small business will soon be compensated for its hard work.
“People should always be able to count on Tesla trying its best,” Musk said in the post to X.",
MSFT,"These three Magnificent Seven stocks are earnings winners
The top tech stocks, known as the Magnificent Seven - Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) have all reported their latest quarterly results. Following the reports, analysts revised their earnings estimates for upcoming quarters.
Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer explains how the Wall Street's views on the Magnificent Seven may be evolving.

Video Transcript
BRAD SMITH: All Magnificent Seven companies have reported their fourth quarter results. The majority seeing upward estimates revision-- estimate revisions rather an average of over 7% for the quarter. That's according to Datatrek
Now, let's bring in ""Yahoo Finance's"" Josh Schafer for more details on this. Hey, Josh.
JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Brad. Datatrek did a great job breaking this down in their evening note last night. And I want to zoom out a little bit here and take a look at some of the other earnings revisions they had.
So we had earnings from all of the Magnificent Seven companies. And then, of course, the big question is, well, what do analysts think are now going to happen for the current quarter for the next year? And maybe even out into 2025? That's what gets priced into these stocks.
So if you take a look here, this is what's changed in earnings estimates over the last 30 days. So this is not expectations for next year, necessarily, directly, it is what has changed in the last 30 days.
You see, really, I think the takeaway here, Seana, you're looking at it. There's only three companies that really saw big changes. And that to me is one of the prevailing takeaways here. NVIDIA Amazon, Meta, the big three winners of this earnings season.
You can see Alphabet actually had its estimates up a little bit. But we were talking about this off air and discussing what do we learn from this. And I think it's the three companies there. And then if you look at year-to-date performance in these stocks, you probably have to give Microsoft a little bit of credit.
Microsoft is up about 8%. So a little bit over the market. So maybe we'll call it 3 and 1/2. But to me, the prevailing takeaway that we've seen in earnings projections, movements is maybe we're not talking about the Magnificent Seven.
Maybe, it's the Fantastic Four or the 3 and 1/2. I don't know. But it seems like we're no longer in this seven tech stock phase. And it's certainly narrowed.
BRAD SMITH: The triple threat. Yeah.
SEANA SMITH: Triple threat. That was a good one. OK. I was trying to I was sitting over here trying to come up with something quick. You beat me to it.
But, Josh, I think also for investors is what this means for the broader market. Zooming out even more, talking about how this is factoring into S&P projections for year end. We've seen a number of analysts, even this week with Barclays out this morning, upping their target even more.
JOSH SCHAFER: And in most of these strategists that are coming out and saying they expect the S&P 500 to rise higher, so Barclays coming out and saying that they think it's going to go to 5,300.
They're boosting their target from 4,800. The main driver of that is big tech. So they're saying they think the economy is going to hold up well, which is, of course, important, because, big tech also needs the economy to do well.
But then they're also highlighting that they think that big tech is going to be the big outperformer here. And they said in this release here in their research, they were highlighting, overall, how much more big tech is worth in the earnings story than the rest of the S&P 500, and really, the rest of big tech.
If you were to remove big tech, I'm looking at their projections for the full year 2024 right now. You're talking about the rest of the S&P 500 being at like $177 worth of earnings. Instead of when you add in big tech you get $46 worth of earnings in that. So it's a significant increase when you're adding in big tech and adding in those high expectations.
That's what's driving these targets higher right now.
SEANA SMITH: It seems like nothing stopping-- what is it? Triple threat--
BRAD SMITH: The trifecta, the hat trick.
JOSH SCHAFER: One day, we got to just do two hours on just the triple threat. We'll just talk about the three stocks.
BRAD SMITH: Triple double.
SEANA SMITH: You're onto something.
JOSH SCHAFER: It's all the--
SEANA SMITH: It's going very well.
JOSH SCHAFER: Who needs the 497?
BRAD SMITH: Nobody.","- Pete Ballmer, the son of Microsoft's former CEO, shared what it's like to grow up with a rich dad.
- The product manager-turned-comedian said he got unwanted attention and differential treatment.
- Still, he doesn't spend his wealth lavishly because of his parents' humble upbringings.
Pete Ballmer, one of three sons of ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, got real about what it's like growing up with an uber-wealthy father during a recent episode of the podcast ""Cash Cuties.""
""I was deeply uncomfortable with all this for the longest time,"" Pete Ballmer said in the interview released earlier this month.
Steve Ballmer, who led the software giant from 2000 to 2014, has a net worth of $121 billion as of February 27, according to Forbes.
The billionaire's son — a 29-year-old stand-up comedian who used to be a project manager — remembered getting preferential treatment up until his mid-20s.
He remembered visiting the Statue of Liberty with his family as a kid and eating a ""nice lunch spread"" at an exclusive, roped-off dining area that sat right next to a long line of visitors waiting to order food.
""When you're a billionaire, people will lay down for you,"" Ballmer said.
Ballmer also got plenty of unwanted attention. After a lacrosse game in middle school, Ballmer distinctly remembered his teammates shouting, ""Apple is better,"" as he made his way through the handshake line.
During a basketball game, one teammate brought up his father and said, ""I would kill to be in your position.""
His discomfort with his family ties continued into his adulthood. When he first started doing stand-up in college, he said he changed his stage name to ""Pete Bronson"" to avoid being associated with his father.
""It was not something I wanted to be a part of who I was,"" Ballmer said. ""It was frustrating to have people plant that on me.""
Of course, money was never an issue. Ballmer said his dad was already president of Microsoft when he was born and got promoted to CEO when he was 9.
Pete Ballmer said his grandpa gave him a ""decent percentage"" of Microsoft stock, which he said was worth ""hundreds and thousands of dollars"" by the time he turned 25.
He went on nice family vacations and grew up in a home with five bathrooms. He even convinced his father to purchase the LA Clippers basketball team.
That doesn't mean Ballmer doesn't see money as disposable. Given his parents' upbringing — his mom grew up on a rural farm in Oregon and his dad in a middle-class household — Bronson internalized the belief that cash needed to be spent wisely.
As a kid, he got $10 a week for allowance. When he got older, he drove a 1998 Lincoln Town Car his father passed down to him.
Ballmer said he does spend big bucks on conveniences like ""stupid irresponsible"" Uber rides and DoorDash takeout to save time, and he uses his generational wealth to support his full-time stand-up comedy career.
He can ""wipe financial errors"" like last-minute flight changes without worrying about the cost.
""I don't want people to see my car and think, 'He's got money,' "" Ballmer said.
While Ballmer seems aware that he grew up with an unusual amount of privilege, he joked that his prestige can only take him so far.
Towards the end of the episode, he recalled a time when he was hitting on a woman in Las Vegas by telling her that his dad was the CEO of Microsoft.
""You need to get a different line,"" she said and walked away.
Correction February 28, 2024: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described how Pete and Steve Ballmer discussed money. Pete Ballmer says he and his father have spoken twice in the last decade about finances with a moderator. The moderator is not present every time they speak about money.","- Microsoft on Monday announced a new partnership with French start-up Mistral AI as the U.S. tech giant seeks to expand its footprint in the fast-evolving artificial intelligence industry.
- Under the deal, Mistral's large language models will be available on Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform, while its ChatGPT style multilingual conversational assistant ""Le Chat"" will be rolled out.
- ""I really think this day is one of the most important days in terms of Microsoft's technology support for Europe,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC on Monday.
Microsoft on Monday announced a new partnership with French start-up Mistral AI – Europe's answer to ChatGPT maker OpenAI — as the U.S. tech giant seeks to expand its footprint in the fast-evolving artificial intelligence industry.
Microsoft said in a statement that it was investing in the 2 billion euro ($2.1 billion), 10-month-old business to help it unlock ""new commercial opportunities"" and expand to global markets. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed Tuesday that it was investing 15 million euros, which would convert into equity in Mistral's next funding round.
Under the deal, Mistral's large language models (LLM) — the technology behind generative AI products — will be available on Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform, becoming only the second company to host its LLM on the platform after OpenAI.
It will also see Microsoft bolster the start-up's access to new customers as it rolls out its ChatGPT-style multilingual conversational assistant ""Le Chat,"" or ""the cat.""
Microsoft President Brad Smith said on Monday that the deal was an ""important"" signal of the company's backing of European technology.
""I really think this day is one of the most important days in terms of Microsoft's technology support for Europe,"" Smith told CNBC's Karen Tso at the Mobile World Congress tech conference in Barcelona, Spain.
""What we're fundamentally agreeing to a long-term partnership with Mistral AI so that they can train and deploy their next generation models for AI on our AI data centres, our infrastructure, effective immediately,"" he added.
Growing scrutiny
It comes as Microsoft is facing pressure from EU antitrust regulators over its reported $13 billion investment in San Francisco-based OpenAI. Asked whether the investment was an effort to appease competition concerns, Smith said the company was committed to having a diverse product offering.
""It's important for us to show that this isn't just about Microsoft technology, it's not just about American products. This is going to be an engine for technology, innovation and growth in Europe as well,"" he said.
Smith said the investment in Mistral AI would also see funds dedicated to research and development, including AI models for public sector services in Europe.
""I think Europe wants, needs and deserves a wide range of offerings,"" Smith said.
Earlier on Monday, Spanish telecoms giant Telefónica announced that it had struck a deal to integrate Microsoft's Azure AI Studio into its digital ecosystem, Kernel, allowing staff to interpret data using generative AI language models.
Rival tech giants such as Google and Amazon have also been ramping up their investments in AI amid a growing frenzy around the emerging technology. Global markets hit record highs last week on the back of bumper results from AI chipmaker Nvidia.","Microsoft’s Mistral AI Investment to Be Examined by EU Watchdog

Microsoft Corp.’s Mistral AI investment is set to be analyzed by the European Union’s competition watchdog at the same time that its deep ties to OpenAI Inc come under regulatory scrutiny.
Mistral announced a “strategic partnership” with Microsoft on Monday that includes making the startup’s latest artificial intelligence models available to customers of Microsoft’s Azure cloud. Microsoft said the investment amounted to €15 million ($16.3 million.)","France had no prior knowledge of Microsoft's Mistral AI deal, official says
By Martin Coulter and Leigh Thomas
LONDON (Reuters) -France had no prior knowledge of Microsoft's partnership with tech startup Mistral AI, a finance ministry official told Reuters, denying suggestions that French lobbying for looser European AI rules had been on behalf of the U.S. tech giant.
Earlier this week, Microsoft said it had made a 15-million euro ($16 million) investment in Mistral, and would soon make the Paris-based company's AI models available via its Azure cloud computing platform.
Following the announcement, a Microsoft spokesperson told Reuters it had invested in Mistral without taking a stake. Later, Microsoft clarified that its investment would convert into equity in Mistral's next funding round, a common practice among big tech companies investing in AI startups.
Mistral and the French government had previously lobbied for looser regulations under the European Union's wide-ranging AI Act, ostensibly to avoid over-regulating smaller startups.
Some EU lawmakers on Tuesday questioned whether Mistral had lobbied on Microsoft's behalf, and the extent of the French government's knowledge of the partnership.
""That story seems to have been a front for an American-influenced big tech lobby,"" Kim van Sparrentak, an EU lawmaker who worked closely on the AI Act, told Reuters. ""The Act almost collapsed under the guise of no rules for 'European champions', and now look. European regulators have been played.""
But the French government denied any prior knowledge of the agreement.
""Yesterday, we learned of the technological partnership between Mistral and Microsoft. It's great news that a young French company has joined Microsoft's previously exclusive partnership with OpenAI on its Azure platform,"" a French finance ministry official told Reuters.
""France, like all other member states, took part in the writing the AI Act. At the time, we were not aware of this partnership project, but it has no specific consequences.""
On Wednesday afternoon, Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch said the company remained committed to its mission as an independent European company.
""We have a reselling agreement with Microsoft, that we’re very excited about,"" he wrote on social media platform X. ""Alongside similar partnerships, it will accelerate our growth.""
Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Microsoft delivered another blowout earnings report Tuesday, tallying its best-ever quarterly revenue for its fifth quarter in a row – a stretch directly coinciding with an explosion in investor interest in artificial intelligence and Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s debut of ChatGPT.
Key Facts
Microsoft’s $62 billion of sales in the three-month period ending last month topped average analyst estimates of $61.1 billion, according to FactSet, while its $2.93 earnings per share topped forecasts of $2.77.
The booming sales topped the prior quarter’s record $56.5 billion, marking an 18% year-over-year increase.
Profits were slightly down last quarter, as the $21.9 billion in net income compared to the September quarter’s $22.3 billion profit, but profits remained up about 30% on an annual basis.
Microsoft shares dipped slightly following the earnings report’s release, moving against the stock’s sweltering stretch, with shares up 11% in 2024 and 70% since the beginning of 2023.
Big Number
30%. That’s how much year-over-year revenue growth Microsoft reported in its intelligent cloud division encompassing its AI-heavy Azure cloud service.
Key Background
Microsoft eclipsed a $3 trillion market capitalization for the first time ever last week, and was the most valuable company in the world as of Tuesday’s market close. Microsoft’s valuation narrowly topped that of Apple, which held the mantle of world’s biggest company for a majority of the last three years until Microsoft reclaimed the throne earlier this month. The Washington-based Microsoft has enjoyed a renaissance on Wall Street largely due to the legacy tech firm’s position as the leader of the broader AI movement.
What To Watch For
Apple will report earnings Thursday afternoon, as will fellow big tech firms Amazon and Meta.

.","- Microsoft and Alphabet reported results that beat analysts' expectations on Tuesday.
- But shares of both companies fell following the reports.
- ""In my general conversations with public market investors and sell-side analysts, few have a correct view of the advertising market,"" said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Madison and Wall.
Results were good, but not good enough.
That's Wall Street's reaction to quarterly results on Tuesday from Alphabet and Microsoft. Both companies reported revenue and earnings that exceeded estimates, yet the stocks sold off after hours, a drop that carried over into Wednesday's trading session.
In investor speak, the stocks were priced for perfection. Prior to earnings, Alphabet was up 56% for the year and climbed to a fresh high last week, exceeding the prior record from late 2021, the peak of the tech boom. Microsoft was up 70% over the past 12 months, also reaching a fresh high recently and surpassing Apple as the most valuable publicly traded company.
The companies generated excitement last year by riding the artificial intelligence wave, and were also lauded by shareholders for their dramatic cost-cutting efforts, which included eliminating thousands of jobs.
In the weeks heading into their earnings reports, investors were buying as if they expected positive surprises. They were left disappointed and nitpicked the numbers.
Alphabet on Tuesday reported 13% revenue growth, the fastest rate of expansion since early 2022. Sales of $86.31 billion topped the average estimate of $85.33 billion, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Earnings per share of $1.64 beat estimates by 5 cents.
Revenue at Microsoft increased 18% to $62.02 billion, topping the $61.12 billion average analyst estimate. EPS of $2.93 was 15 cents above consensus.
Both companies also beat expectations in their cloud businesses, with Google Cloud reporting 25% growth and Microsoft's larger Azure and other cloud services expanding 30%.
The one disappointment from Alphabet was in Google's ad business, which delivered revenue of $65.52 billion, trailing analysts' estimates of $65.94 billion, according to StreetAccount. Within ads, YouTube came in just shy of expectations.
Stifel analysts, who recommend buying the stock, said in a quick-take report on Tuesday that Alphabet produced ""healthy advertising results, but not enough.""
Brian Wieser, an analyst at media and advertising consultancy Madison and Wall, said the market has unrealistic expectations for Google given its size and dominance.
""In my general conversations with public market investors and sell-side analysts, few have a correct view of the advertising market,"" Wieser said. ""Many think that growth can continue at double-digit levels for the fastest-growing companies for much longer a period of time than is realistic to expect.""
Alphabet shares dropped 7.5% on Wednesday. Microsoft's decline was less severe, with the stock falling 2.7%.
Microsoft's outlook was a bit light, overshadowing the earnings and revenue beat. The company called for fiscal third-quarter sales between $60 billion and $61 billion, while analysts polled by LSEG had expected $60.93 billion.
Shares of chipmaker AMD also dropped despite better-than-expected revenue numbers and profit that met estimates. The stock, which is up 137% in the past year on excitement about its artificial intelligence processors, fell almost 6% after the announcement.
Attention now turns to Thursday, when Amazon, Apple and Meta all report quarterly results. Similar to Alphabet and Microsoft, Meta shares have climbed to a record this month. Apple hit its all-time high in December, while Amazon remains about 6% below its record from 2022.

It’s been a rough year for Tesla TSLA. As other members of the so-called magnificent 7 rocket to record valuations – Nvidia NVDA is up over 235% since last February; Microsoft MSFT is up over 50% – the EV pioneer is flat, trading near the same level as this time last year and down about 30% from its summer peak.
The company released its quarterly numbers at the end of January, missing again on earnings per share and revenue. The stock dropped over 12% on the day.
So why did Cathie Wood scoop up 377,000 shares of the stock for her ARK Innovation ETF ARKK?
Business As Usual
This is the investing guru's strategy. Wood still believes in the long-term vision of the company, so buying after a large dip means she is getting a discount.
Wood constantly rebalances her fund's holdings by selling off overperforming stocks and buying underperforming ones. This is the strategy that has helped ARKK return 22% on the year.
Eyes On The Horizon
Tesla still has a lot of promise; Wood is betting big on the company delivering on its promise. Tesla has a vision of the future where its autonomous driving technology drives the automotive industry and its autonomous robots are ubiquitous. The company is investing heavily in the AI and robotics necessary for this vision to come to fruition. If it delivers, the potential revenue will easily validate a stock price much higher than the roughly $200 it currently sits at.
Max View
Traders bullish on Wood and her fund can buy the ETF directly or for those who want to further maximize their view, leveraged funds can help. For example, the award-winning AXS 2X Innovation ETF TARK aims to return twice the daily return of ARKK.
And for traders not buying what Wood is selling, AXS offers an option for the bears. The AXS Short Innovation Daily ETF SARK, which aims to return the inverse performance of ARKK, can be an attractive option.
TARK was just awarded Best ETF Launch at Benzinga's 2023 Fintech Awards. The innovative fund was launched in May of 2022 and the care and skill with which the fund is operated is clear.

The clash between Musk and Microsoft unfolded on Tuesday when Nadella shared news of the company's collaboration with Mistral AI, a frontrunner in generative artificial intelligence. In response, Musk expressed his plea to Nadella, stating, “Satya, I don’t mean to be a pest, but please allow people setting up a new Windows PC to skip creating a Microsoft account.”

Google parent Alphabet lost some $90 billion in market value Monday as controversy over the Silicon Valley giant’s generative artificial intelligence product made its way to Wall Street.
Key Facts
Shares of Alphabet fell 4.5% to $138.75 Monday, closing at its lowest price since Jan. 5 and registering its second-steepest daily loss of the last year.
The selloff followed a spate of controversy surrounding Google’s Gemini AI service, with issues including Gemini’s image-generating service producing racially inaccurate depictions of historical figures and its chatbot refusing to determine the more negatively impactful historical figure between Adolf Hitler and Elon Musk, culminating in the company’s admission it “missed the mark” with Gemini’s early rollout and taking its AI image service offline for the next few weeks.
“This is a meaningful blunder in the PR battle surrounding [generative AI] and further suggests that Google is trailing and mis-executing in a fast-moving and high-stakes space,” Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a note to clients Sunday.
Alphabet’s losses came as major stock indexes were flat in a rather uneventful day of trading, and Alphabet was the biggest percentage faller among S&P 500 constituents with a market capitalization over $50 billion.
Crucial Quote
“The issue for the stock is not the debate [over Gemini] itself, it is the perception of truth behind the brand,” Melius Research analysts Ben Reitzes and Nick Monroe wrote in a Monday note to clients. “Regardless of your view, if Google is seen as an unreliable source for AI to a portion of the population, that isn’t good for business,” the analysts continued.
Key Background
Alphabet propulsion into the “crosshairs” of the culture war debate could challenge its stranglehold in the online search market, the Melius group hypothesized, considering AI’s burgeoning role in online search and the possibility of “a meaningful portion of users grow[ing] concerned about Google’s hallucinations and bias.” Gemini’s apparent bias is the latest flub by Alphabet during the AI arms race, in which rival Microsoft appears to be in pole position. Alphabet famously lost more than $100 billion in market capitalization on the day of the announcement of its AI chatbot service last February after the press release included factual errors made by the service.
Surprising Fact
Alphabet stock is down 1% year-to-date, trailing the S&P’s 7% gain and tech-heavy Nasdaq’s 8% rally, as well as the double-digit gains of rivals like Microsoft and Meta.

Bonds","Last Wednesday, when the questions about Gemini’s political viewpoint were still limited to its image creation capabilities, I accused the company of being timid:
Stepping back, I don’t, as a rule, want to wade into politics, and definitely not into culture war issues. At some point, though, you just have to state plainly that this is ridiculous. Google specifically, and tech companies broadly, have long been sensitive to accusations of bias; that has extended to image generation, and I can understand the sentiment in terms of depicting theoretical scenarios. At the same time, many of these images are about actual history; I’m reminded of George Orwell in 1984:
Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right. I know, of course, that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, even when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don’t know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories.
Even if you don’t want to go so far as to invoke the political implications of Orwell’s book, the most generous interpretation of Google’s over-aggressive RLHF of their models is that they are scared of being criticized. That, though, is just as bad: Google is blatantly sacrificing its mission to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” by creating entirely new realities because it’s scared of some bad press. Moreover, there are implications for business: Google has the models and the infrastructure, but winning in AI given their business model challenges will require boldness; this shameful willingness to change the world’s information in an attempt to avoid criticism reeks — in the best case scenario! — of abject timidity.
If timidity were the motivation, then it’s safe to say that the company’s approach with Gemini has completely backfired; while Google turned off Gemini’s image generation capabilities, it’s text generation is just as absurd:
I was able to replicate this! They need to shut Gemini down. It is several months away from being ready for prime time. It is astounding that Google released it in this state. https://t.co/wCqKE1eLbI pic.twitter.com/dxWavP3oei
— Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) February 25, 2024
That is just one examples of many: Gemini won’t help promote meat, write a brief about fossil fuels, or even help sell a goldfish. It says that effective accelerationism is a violent ideology, that libertarians are morally equivalent to Stalin, and insists that it’s hard to say what caused more harm: repealing net neutrality or Hitler.
Some of these examples, particularly the Hitler comparisons (or Mao vs George Washington), are obviously absurd and downright offensive; others are merely controversial. They do, though, all seem to have a consistent viewpoint: Nate Silver, in another tweet, labeled it “the politics of the median member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.”
Needless to say, overtly expressing those opinions is not timid, which raises another question from Silver:
Gemini is behaving exactly as instructed. Asking it to draw different groups of people (e.g. ""Vikings"" or ""NHL players"") is the base case, not an edge case. The questions are all about how it got greenlit by a $1.8T market cap company despite this incredibly predictable behavior.
— Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) February 23, 2024
In fact, I think there is a precedent for Gemini; like many comparison points for modern-day Google, it comes from Microsoft.
Microsoft and The Curse of Culture
Microsoft workers celebrated the release to manufacturing of Windows Phone 7 by parading through their Redmond campus on Friday with iPhone and BlackBerry hearses. Employees dressed up in fancy dress and also modified cars to include Windows Phone branding. Aside from the crazy outfits the workers made fake hearses for giant BlackBerry and iPhone devices. Employees cheekily claimed they had buried the competition with Windows Phone 7.
This was, to be clear, insane. I wrote about the episode in 2013’s The Curse of Culture; it’s been eight years, so I hope you’ll allow me a particularly long excerpt:
As with most such things, culture is one of a company’s most powerful assets right until it isn’t: the same underlying assumptions that permit an organization to scale massively constrain the ability of that same organization to change direction. More distressingly, culture prevents organizations from even knowing they need to do so. From Edgar Schein’s Organizational Culture and Leadership:
Basic assumptions, like theories-in-use, tend to be nonconfrontable and nondebatable, and hence are extremely difficult to change. To learn something new in this realm requires us to resurrect, reexamine, and possibly change some of the more stable portions of our cognitive structure…Such learning is intrinsically difficult because the reexamination of basic assumptions temporarily destabilizes our cognitive and interpersonal world, releasing large quantities of basic anxiety. Rather than tolerating such anxiety levels, we tend to want to perceive the events around us as congruent with our assumptions, even if that means distorting, denying, projecting, or in other ways falsifying to ourselves what may be going on around us. It is in this psychological process that culture has its ultimate power.
Probably the canonical example of this mindset was Microsoft after the launch of the iPhone. It’s hard to remember now, but no company today comes close to matching the stranglehold Microsoft had on the computing industry from 1985 to 2005 or so. The company had audacious goals — “A computer on every desk and in every home, running Microsoft software” — which it accomplished and then surpassed: the company owned enterprise back offices as well. This unprecedented success changed that goal — originally an espoused belief — into an unquestioned assumption that of course all computers should be Microsoft-powered. Given this, the real shock would have been then-CEO Steve Ballmer not laughing at the iPhone.
A year-and-a-half later, Microsoft realized that Windows Mobile, their current phone OS, was not competitive with the iPhone and work began on what became Windows Phone. Still, unacknowledged cultural assumptions remained: one, that Microsoft had the time to bring to bear its unmatched resources to make something that might be worse at the beginning but inevitably superior over time, and two, that the company could leverage Windows’ dominance and their Office business. Both assumptions had become cemented in Microsoft’s victory in the browser wars and their slow-motion takeover of corporate data centers; in truth, though, Microsofts’ mobile efforts were already doomed, and nearly everyone realized it before Windows Phone even launched with a funeral for the iPhone.
Steve Ballmer never figured it out; his last acts were to reorganize the company around a “One Microsoft” strategy centered on Windows, and to buy Nokia to prop up Windows Phone. It fell to Satya Nadella, his successor, to change the culture, and it’s why the fact his first public event was to announce Office for iPad was so critical. I wrote at the time:
This is the power CEOs have. They cannot do all the work, and they cannot impact industry trends beyond their control. But they can choose whether or not to accept reality, and in so doing, impact the worldview of all those they lead.
Microsoft under Nadella’s leadership has, over the last three years, undergone a tremendous transformation, embracing its destiny as a device-agnostic service provider; still, it is fighting the headwinds of Amazon’s cloud, open source tooling, and the fact that mobile users had six years to get used to a world without Microsoft software. How much stronger might the company have been had it faced reality in 2007, but the culture made that impossible.
Google is not in nearly as bad of shape as Microsoft was when it held that funeral. The company’s revenue and profits are as high as ever, and the release of Gemini 1.5 in particular demonstrated how well-placed the company is for the AI era: the company not only has leading research, it also has unmatched infrastructure that enables entirely new and valuable use cases. That, though, makes the Gemini fiasco all the more notable.
Don’t Be Evil
The questions around Google and AI have, to date, been mostly about business model. In last year’s AI and the Big Five I talked about how Kodak invented the digital camera, but didn’t pursue it because of business model reasons, and made the obvious analogy to Google’s seeming inability to ship:
Google has long been a leader in using machine learning to make its search and other consumer-facing products better (and has offered that technology as a service through Google Cloud). Search, though, has always depended on humans as the ultimate arbiter: Google will provide links, but it is the user that decides which one is the correct one by clicking on it. This extended to ads: Google’s offering was revolutionary because instead of charging advertisers for impressions — the value of which was very difficult to ascertain, particularly 20 years ago — it charged for clicks; the very people the advertisers were trying to reach would decide whether their ads were good enough…
That, though, ought only increase the concern for Google’s management that generative AI may, in the specific context of search, represent a disruptive innovation instead of a sustaining one. Disruptive innovation is, at least in the beginning, not as good as what already exists; that’s why it is easily dismissed by managers who can avoid thinking about the business model challenges by (correctly!) telling themselves that their current product is better. The problem, of course, is that the disruptive product gets better, even as the incumbent’s product becomes ever more bloated and hard to use — and that certainly sounds a lot like Google Search’s current trajectory.
Google has started shipping, and again, Gemini 1.5 is an incredible breakthrough; the controversy over Gemini, though, is a reminder that culture can restrict success as well. Google has its own unofficial motto — “Don’t Be Evil” — that founder Larry Page explained in the company’s S-1:
Don’t be evil. We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served — as shareholders and in all other ways — by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains. This is an important aspect of our culture and is broadly shared within the company.
Google users trust our systems to help them with important decisions: medical, financial and many others. Our search results are the best we know how to produce. They are unbiased and objective, and we do not accept payment for them or for inclusion or more frequent updating. We also display advertising, which we work hard to make relevant, and we label it clearly. This is similar to a newspaper, where the advertisements are clear and the articles are not influenced by the advertisers’ payments. We believe it is important for everyone to have access to the best information and research, not only to the information people pay for you to see.
Google has by-and-large held to that promise, at least as defined by Page: the company does not sell search result placement. Of course the company has made ads look more and more like organic results, and crammed ever more into the search results page, and squeezed more and more verticals, but while there are always whispers about what is or isn’t included in search, or the decisions made by the algorithm, most people still trust the product, and use it countless times every day.
One does wonder, though, if the sanctity of search felt limiting to some inside of Google. In 2018 a video leaked of an all-hands meeting after the 2016 election where Google executives expressed dismay over the results; the footage was damaging enough that Google felt compelled to issue a statement:
At a regularly scheduled all hands meeting, some Google employees and executives expressed their own personal views in the aftermath of a long and divisive election season. For over 20 years, everyone at Google has been able to freely express their opinions at these meetings. Nothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products. To the contrary, our products are built for everyone, and we design them with extraordinary care to be a trustworthy source of information for everyone, without regard to political viewpoint.
Perhaps this seemed to some employees to be an outdated view of the world; I’m reminded of that quote from Angela Y Davis: “In a racist society it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist.” In this view calls for color-blindness in terms of opportunity are insufficient; the only acceptable outcome is one in which outcomes are equal as well. The equivalent in the case of Google would be that it is not enough to not be evil; one must be “anti-evil” as well.
The end result is that just as Microsoft could, shielded by years of a Windows monopoly, delude themselves into thinking they had an iPhone killer, Google could, shielded by years of a search monopoly, delude themselves into thinking they had not just the right but the obligation to tell users what they ought to believe.
After Gemini
As I noted in the excerpt, I very much try to avoid politics on Stratechery; I want to talk about business models and societal impact, and while that has political implications, it doesn’t need to be partisan (for example, I think this piece about the 2016 election holds up very well, and isn’t partisan in the slightest). AI, though, is increasingly giving all of us no choice in the matter.
To that end, my Article last fall about the Biden executive order, Attenuating Innovation, was clearly incomplete: not only must we keep in mind the potential benefits of AI — which are massive — but it is clearly essential that we allow open source models to flourish as well. It is Google or OpenAI’s prerogative to train their models to have whatever viewpoint they want; any meaningful conception of freedom should make space for an open market of alternatives, and that means open source.
Secondly, it behooves me, and everyone else in tech, to write Articles like the one you are reading; “the politics of the median member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors” has had by far the loudest voice in tech because most people just want to build cool new things, or write about them, without being fired or yelled at on social media. This does, though, give the perception that tech is out of touch, or actively authoritarian; I don’t think that’s true, but those of us who don’t want to tell everyone else what to think, do, paradoxically, need to say so.
The biggest question of all, though, is Google. Again, this is a company that should dominate AI, thanks to their research and their infrastructure. The biggest obstacle, though, above and beyond business model, is clearly culture. To that end, the nicest thing you can say about Google’s management is to assume that they, like me and everyone else, just want to build products and not be yelled at; that, though, is not leadership. Schein writes:
When we examine culture and leadership closely, we see that they are two sides of the same coin; neither can really be understood by itself. On the one hand, cultural norms define how a given nation or organizations will define leadership — who will get promoted, who will get the attention of followers. On the other hand, it can be argued that the only thing of real importance that leaders do is to create and manage culture; that the unique talent of leaders is their ability to understand and work with culture; and that it is an ultimate act of leadership to destroy culture when it is viewed as dysfunctional.
That is exactly what Nadella did at Microsoft. I recounted in The End of Windows how Nadella changed the company’s relationship to Windows, unlocking the astronomical growth that has happened under his watch, including the company’s position in AI.
Google, quite clearly, needs a similar transformation: the point of the company ought not be to tell users what to think, but to help them make important decisions, as Page once promised. That means, first and foremost, excising the company of employees attracted to Google’s power and its potential to help them execute their political program, and return decision-making to those who actually want to make a good product. That, by extension, must mean removing those who let the former run amok, up to and including CEO Sundar Pichai. The stakes, for Google specifically and society broadly, are too high to simply keep one’s head down and hope that the San Francisco Board of Supervisors magically comes to its senses.

A significant portion of the market's impressive run since the start of 2023 can be attributed to the monumental rise of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. These businesses are industry-leading entities with a focus on innovation and tech-forward thinking.
A quick look at these companies reveals that their stock prices might be on the expensive side of things. This makes sense, given how much they've rewarded shareholders in recent times. Prospective investors might be discouraged in thinking they missed the rally.
But there are two Magnificent Seven constituents that still appear to be extremely smart buys right now. Let's take a closer look at Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META).
Dominating the industry
Both of these internet giants touch the lives of billions of people on a daily basis. Alphabet has six products and services that have more than 2 billion users each. And Google Search, for instance, commands a remarkable 91% share of the global search industry.
Meta, with its popular social media apps, counts 4 billion monthly active users. That figure was up 6% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023.
When it comes to unrivaled scale and limited competitive threats, I don't know if there are any two businesses on the planet that hold a candle to Alphabet and Meta. While it's true that anyone with some funding and tech prowess can create a new search engine or social media app from scratch, adding users would be an insurmountable task.
Both of these companies benefit from powerful network effects and tremendous data advantages that minimize the risk of disruption. I don't think any other characteristics exemplify just how high quality Alphabet and Meta are.
The result is that combined, they generate 57% of the world's digital ad revenue in an industry that is set to register sizable growth going forward. And with both enterprises focused on making huge investments in artificial intelligence capabilities, their ability to serve up better-targeted ads will be compelling for marketers.
Impressive financials
These companies have impressive track records of growing both revenue and income at high rates in the past, which has propelled their share prices. In the last five years, Alphabet's and Meta's operating margins averaged 25.8% and 34.2%, respectively, a clear sign of their outsized profitability.
These are financially sound businesses that generate tens of billions of dollars in operating cash flow on a quarterly basis. Combined, they had a net cash position of $145 billion on their balance sheets as of Dec. 31. This favorable situation virtually eliminates any financial risk from their businesses, while providing seemingly unlimited resources to continue investing aggressively in growth opportunities.
While Meta just announced a tiny dividend, these companies have generally returned capital to shareholders via stock buybacks. In the past few years, they have done a wonderful job at shrinking their outstanding share counts, which boosts their earnings per share.
It's not too late
Even after their gains in the last year, these stocks aren't trading at nosebleed valuations. It's actually the opposite.
As of this writing, Alphabet and Meta sell for forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 21.2 and 24.3, respectively. For comparison's sake, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index trades at a forward P/E multiple of 30.3. And even more noteworthy, based on this metric, these two stocks are cheaper than any of the other Magnificent Seven companies.
Based on all of the fantastic qualities, adding these two businesses to your portfolio looks like a no-brainer decision.

Are These the 2 Best ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks to Buy Right Now? was originally published by The Motley Fool","The historically inaccurate images and text generated by Google’s Gemini AI have “offended our users and shown bias,” CEO Sundar Pichai told employees in an internal memo obtained by The Verge.
Last week, Google paused Gemini’s ability to generate images after it was widely discovered that the model generated racially diverse, Nazi-era German soldiers, US Founding Fathers who were non-white, and even inaccurately portrayed the races of Google’s own co-founders. While Google has since apologized for “missing the mark” and said it’s working to re-enable image generation in the coming weeks, Tuesday’s memo is the first time the CEO has widely addressed the controversy.
In the memo, which was first reported by Semafor, Pichai says the company has “been working around the clock” to address “problematic text and image responses in the Gemini app.” He doesn’t say that Google has fixed the problem. “No Al is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry’s development, but we know the bar is high for us and we will keep at it for however long it takes,” he writes.
You can read Sundar Pichai’s full memo to Google employees below:
Hi everyone
I want to address the recent issues with problematic text and image responses in the Gemini app (formerly Bard). I know that some of its responses have offended our users and shown bias — to be clear, that’s completely unacceptable and we got it wrong.
Our teams have been working around the clock to address these issues. We’re already seeing a substantial improvement on a wide range of prompts. No Al is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry’s development, but we know the bar is high for us and we will keep at it for however long it takes. And we’ll review what happened and make sure we fix it at scale.
Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is sacrosanct. We’ve always sought to give users helpful, accurate, and unbiased information in our products. That’s why people trust them. This has to be our approach for all our products, including our emerging Al products.
We’ll be driving a clear set of actions, including structural changes, updated product guidelines, improved launch processes, robust evals and red-teaming, and technical recommendations. We are looking across all of this and will make the necessary changes.
Even as we learn from what went wrong here, we should also build on the product and technical announcements we’ve made in Al over the last several weeks. That includes some foundational advances in our underlying models e.g. our 1 million long-context window breakthrough and our open models, both of which have been well received.
We know what it takes to create great products that are used and beloved by billions of people and businesses, and with our infrastructure and research expertise we have an incredible springboard for the Al wave. Let’s focus on what matters most: building helpful products that are deserving of our users’ trust.","Topline
Google CEO Sundar Pichai addressed the controversy around its Gemini AI service generating misleading and historically inaccurate images Tuesday, in an internal note saying the issue was “completely unacceptable,” a week after the company paused its ability to generate images of people.
Key Facts
In an internal note first reported by Semafor, Pichai wrote he was aware that some of Gemini’s responses “have offended our users and shown bias” and added: “To be clear, that’s completely unacceptable and we got it wrong.”
Pichai said teams are “working around the clock to address these issues” and the company has seen a “substantial improvement,” without going into further detail.
The CEO’s note then promised a “clear set of actions” to resolve the issue, including structural changes, refreshed product guidelines, technical recommendations, better evaluations and red-teaming (a process of simulating harmful behavior to spot vulnerabilities).
Pichai’s note also signaled that the company will move forward with its AI roadmap and “build on the product and technical announcements” made in the past few weeks.
Crucial Quote
Addressing concerns of bias in Gemini’s AI model, Pichai wrote: “We’ve always sought to give users helpful, accurate, and unbiased information in our products. That’s why people trust them. This has to be our approach for all our products, including our emerging AI products.”
Big Number
3.58%. That is how much Google’s stock value has fallen since the end of last week as the company scrambled to deal with the fallout. The selloff shaved $90 billion off the company’s market cap Monday before the stock mounted a slight recovery over the next few days to end at $140.10 per share.
Key Background
Google widely launched Gemini earlier this month, replacing its former AI-powered chatbot Bard. Built on the company’s latest AI models, Gemini was touted as a competitor to Microsoft and OpenAI’s offerings like CoPilot, ChatGPT and DALL-E and other generative AI tools like Midjourney and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion. The controversy around Gemini’s image generation tool emerged last week after users found they were able to generate historically inaccurate images like Black vikings, racially diverse Nazi soldiers and a female pope. Billionaire Elon Musk, who is building xAI as a competitor to Gemini, attacked Google’s service, calling it “woke” and “racist.” Other outlets like the Verge pointed out Gemini’s inaccuracies, noting that a prompt for a “US senator from the 1800s” generated images of a Black woman, even though the first Black woman was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992. Google halted the service from generating images of people after the controversy spiraled and said the company would “further tune” Gemini to offer more accurate historical contexts.

What is Gemini AI?
Google recently rebranded its chatbot Bard as Gemini, while officially unrolling the artificial intelligence (AI) tool for users globally. According to the tech giant, users can now engage with the Gemini Pro 1.0 model in over 40 languages across more than 230 countries and territories.
Gemini Advanced is part of the Google One AI Premium Plan, priced at $19.99/month, starting with a complimentary two-month trial period. AI Premium subscribers can anticipate the integration of Gemini into various Google applications such as Gmail, Docs, Slides, Sheets, and more (formerly known as Duet AI), as mentioned in the latest Google blog post.

A Whirlwind of Controversies
Within a week of launch, there have already been controversies. Google apologised on February 23 for its faulty rollout of a new AI image-generator linked to Gemini AI, acknowledging that in some cases the tool would “overcompensate"" for lack of diversity even when it didn't make sense, as per an AP report.
Addressing concerns, Google said it has decided to temporarily halt the chatbot's image generation. Prabhakar Raghavan, a senior vice president overseeing Google's search engine and other businesses, in a blog post stated, ""It’s clear that this feature missed the mark"", and apologised for inaccurate and offensive images, and expressed gratitude for user feedback.

Although Raghavan did not cite specific examples, social media highlighted instances where the Gemini AI image generator depicted a Black woman as a United States founding father, besides showing Black and Asian individuals as Nazi-era German soldiers, AP reported.
Raghavan defended the chatbot's intent, adding that the goal for the feature was to cater to diverse requests, but added that some prompts triggered ""overcompensation"".

India May Issue Notice to Google over 'Biased' Gemini AI
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) is likely to issue a notice to Google over Gemini's “biased"" response to a question about Prime Minister Narendra Modi, reports said on February 23.
Gemini came under fire for allegedly being ""biased"" against PM Modi after an X user took to the social media platform to complain about the too, The viral post claims to show the AI model's ""bias"" to a query on PM Modi, former US president Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
It was claimed that when asked a question about fascism, the Gemini AI tool displayed a proper reply about PM Modi. However, when the same question was asked about Donald Trump and Zelenskyy, the AI tool refused to give a clear answer.
Earlier in the day, Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar reacted to the complaint by the X user and said that the platform violates IT rules and other laws. ""These are direct violations of Rule 3(1)(b) of Intermediary Rules (IT rules) of the IT act and violations of several provisions of the Criminal code,"" Chandrasekhar said, tagging Google and the Meity, indicating further action in the matter.
