MMM,"[""MMMZacks Equity ResearchNovember 2, 2023 at 6:00 AM·5 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowMMMWatchlist3M (MMM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this maker of Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics have returned +2.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, which 3M falls in, has lost 8.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.3M is expected to post earnings of $2.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -9.7%. This estimate has changed +2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.85 indicates a change of +8% from what 3M is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, 3M is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of 3M, the consensus sales estimate of $7.67 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -5%. The $31.76 billion and $32.39 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -7.2% and +2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise History3M reported revenues of $8.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.6%. EPS of $2.68 for the same period compares with $2.69 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.95 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.52%. The EPS surprise was +14.53%.Over the last four quarters, 3M surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.3M is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about 3M. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of income-generating stocks and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Income.\xa0Markets are wavering amid a mix of corporate earnings reports that didn't meet expectations and worries about rising interest rates. Notably, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note briefly surpassed the 5% mark, a level not seen in 16 years, which further contributed to investor concerns. They are now looking more at assets that generate income due to the current uncertainty. A strong income-focused portfolio combines various income-generating assets like bonds, dividend stocks, and real estate. This mix helps lower risks and enhances the potential for steady, long-term returns.Also read: 12 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive IncomeDividend stocks offer more than just income; they create a virtuous cycle of growth. Strong dividend growth is beneficial for investors in several ways. It can enhance returns and act as a shield against inflation by offering a steadily increasing income stream, much like an annual raise in your earnings. Additionally, dividend-growing stocks have the potential for price appreciation because they often reflect a company's improving earnings and dividend payments over time. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, historically, large-cap dividend-growing stocks have shown resilience during market downturns, experienced smaller losses, and performed well when the market remained stable. In addition, they've managed to capture a significant portion of the market's upswings during more favorable economic conditions. The report also mentioned that over the period from 1985 to 2022, companies that increased their dividends within the Russell 1000 Index outperformed the overall market index, and they did so with less volatility.Lower volatility is one of the factors that attract investors to dividend stocks. The reduced price fluctuations in dividend stocks can provide a sense of stability and predictability in an investor's portfolio, which is especially appealing to those who prioritize income generation and want to avoid significant market ups and downs. Wisdom Tree reported that over the past 64 years, dividend levels decreased in just six years, and only once did they drop by more than 5%. In contrast, stock prices experienced declines in 18 of those 64 years, with the worst yearly drop exceeding 40% and an average decline of over 11%. This data suggests that stock prices are significantly more volatile than the cash flows from dividends.Story continuesSome of the best stocks to buy for income include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the investment strategy and the performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dogs of the Dow Stocks Ranked By Hedge Fund Sentiment.\xa0The Dogs of the Dow strategy is an investment approach that involves selecting and investing in the top 10 dividend-yielding stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) on an annual basis. The strategy assumes that these high-yield stocks, or ""Dogs,"" are temporarily undervalued or out of favor, and by investing in them, investors can benefit from potential price appreciation while receiving a steady income from dividends. Many financial experts have explained the strategy thoroughly to help investors gain a deep understanding of it. Robert R. Johnson, professor of finance at the Heider College of Business at Creighton University, spoke about the Dogs in one of his interviews with Business Insider. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The underlying premise behind the strategy is mean reversion. The [Dogs of the Dow] is based on the theory that stocks can be over or undervalued, but over the long run those that are undervalued will \'revert to the mean.”Over time, the Dogs of the Dow strategy has been a good way for investors to make money, especially during slow economic growth. Various reports have pointed out the strong performance of this strategy over time, which has increased investors\' trust in it. In one of our articles on the topic, we referred to the Wall Street Journal’s report which said that the strategy returned 34.3% in 2013 through December 26, outperforming the Dow, which gained 28.9% during that time. The report also noted that this strategy outperformed the market for a significant part of the 1970s and 1980s. Over the long term, the strategy has also done better than its standard benchmark. According to Forbes, from 1957 to 2003, the Dogs outperformed the broader index by 3%.Story continuesOn average, since 2010, the Dogs of the Dow have shown returns that are very similar to the broader market index. Robert R. Johnson has commented on the recent performance of the strategy.""While they have produced similar returns over that 12-year period, some individual years have seen quite a divergence in performance. In 2020, for example, the DJIA gained 7.2% while the Dogs suffered a loss of 12.7%. The Dogs also underperformed in 2021, when the Dogs generated a return of 16.3% versus 20.8% for the DJIA.""The report also compared the Dogs’ returns with that of the S&P 500. The report revealed that the Dogs had an average annual return of 13.6%, while the S&P 500 had 13.9% per year, generating nearly similar returns during this period. Some of the best stocks from the category include JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) as these stocks have high yields. In this article, we will discuss the best Dogs of the Dow according to hedge funds.Best Dogs of the Dow Stocks Ranked By Hedge Fund SentimentPhoto by Karolina Grabowska from PexelsOur Methodology:We started with a list of 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and selected dividend-paying stocks from that list.

Mike?Story continuesMichael Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, we built momentum through strong operational execution as we again delivered for our customers, positioning us for a solid close to 2023. On an adjusted basis, we delivered earnings ahead of our expectations, expanded margins sequentially across all four businesses, and achieved our third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth in free cash flow. As we make progress and deliver improved financial results, we are increasing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $8.95 to $9.15, up from a previous range of $8.60 to $9.10, and our adjusted free cash flow conversion range to 100% to 110%, up from 90% to 100% previously.We continue to deliver against our priorities. We are driving performance throughout 3M with strong operational execution, restructuring actions, and spending discipline. We are progressing the spin of the healthcare business, which we expect to be completed during the first half of 2024. And we are reducing risk and uncertainty by reaching significant settlements to address combat arms and PFAS litigation. I will now provide some additional context around how we are advancing these priorities. Next slide, please. Our margin expansion clearly demonstrates the performance our team is driving throughout 3M. We delivered 240 basis points of year-over-year adjusted operating income margin expansion, excluding 80 basis points of restructuring-related charges.We are strengthening our business in several important ways. We are progressing with our restructuring actions to streamline our organization, reduce structural costs, and get us closer to customers. We have leaned out the center of our Company, simplified our global supply chain organization, and optimized our global go-to-market models. At the same time, we are advancing supply chain performance to improve service, drive productivity and yield, expand gross margins, and increase cash conversion. These results are being supported by initiatives that use our continuous improvement toolkit and leverage data and data analytics. For example, we have benefited from more than 60 Kaizen events this year to improve existing processes in our largest plants.We are also progressing the spin of our healthcare business, building the leadership team as we work toward completing the spin in the first half of 2024. During the quarter, we added two experienced leaders, naming Bryan Hanson as the CEO of the Standalone Healthcare Business and Kerry Cox as the Board Chair. Finally, we continue to manage risk and uncertainty by proactively and effectively managing litigation. We announced the combat arms settlement, and we are working with all parties and the courts to implement it. The settlement administration process has been established and funded. The bellwether trial verdicts have been settled, and the process for notifying and settling with claimants has begun. With respect to PFAS, the public water supplier settlement we announced last quarter has received preliminary court approval.We successfully resolved objections from state attorneys general and are working toward approval with the final hearing set for early February next year. In closing, I want to share a few thoughts about our future. Our momentum accelerates our ability to define where we go next at 3M. As we prioritize attractive markets, where we have the right to win, and the opportunity to differentiate ourselves through our unique capabilities and strengths; a good example is our automotive OEM business, where we continue to outperform the market with double-digit growth this quarter. Auto electrification is on track to be a $600 million business this year and has delivered organic growth of 30% year to date. Our material science expertise has led us to build a new business, and we see similar opportunities in other core platforms such as safety, home improvement, and consumer electronics.We are also prioritizing emerging global trends that have attractive growth rates and customer needs that match up well with 3M capabilities. We are building new platforms in areas like climate technology, industrial automation, and next-generation electronics. Before I hand it over to Monish for additional insight into our performance, a few closing thoughts. I am pleased with the way our teams are executing. They delivered third-quarter results that build on the momentum we saw in the second quarter, setting us up for a solid close to 2023. We are advancing our priorities, driving performance, progressing our healthcare spin, and reducing risk and uncertainty. 3M is delivering today lower costs, better margins, and greater cash generation and building for tomorrow, prioritizing growth platforms, innovating with impact, and empowering our teams.I will now turn it over to Monish for more details on the third quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Monish?Monish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to slide five. As Mike mentioned, we are seeing significant traction from the actions we are taking to strengthen the business. Through a focus on customers, effective adjustment of production, benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives, ongoing proactive spending discipline, and the relentless focus on managing inventory, we were able to deliver solid adjusted third-quarter results, including sales of $8 billion at the high-end of our guidance range of $7.9 billion to $8 billion, operating margins of 23.2%, an increase of 160 basis points year-on-year and 390 basis points sequentially; earnings per share of $2.68, a year-on-year increase of 3%, and free cash flow of $1.9 billion, up 39% year-on-year with conversion of 130%.Organic sales on an adjusted basis declined 3.1% versus last year. This included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million, or 1.7 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand and last year's exit of our operations in Russia. Excluding this, Q3 adjusted organic sales were down 1.4%. Consumer and electronics end markets continue to be soft. Our adjusted organic sales declined year-on-year mid-single digits in our electronics business and high-single digits in consumer. This softness was partially offset by strength in our automotive OEM business. Regionally, the U.S. was up slightly despite continued challenges in retail. Europe remained soft, and China was down mid-teens year-on-year organically due to continued end-market softness along with lapping strong sales backlog recovery in the prior year.Our strong adjusted EPS of $2.68, exceeded our expectations of $2.25 to $2.40. Roughly two-thirds of the beat was driven by operational execution in our supply chain and proactive spending discipline, and a balance driven by restructuring timing. The restructuring actions we announced earlier this year are largely on track and we are seeing favorable margin impact in our results. We continue to expect full year pre-tax restructuring benefits of $400 million to $450 million with offsetting charges. Turning to slide six for the components that drove our year-on-year operating margin and earnings performance, manufacturing productivity and restructuring actions, strong spending discipline, and selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume, investments in the business, and the previously mentioned headwind from disposable respirator and last year's exit of Russia, resulted an improvement to operating margins of 260 basis points and to earnings of $0.22 per share.Pre-tax restructuring and related charges in the quarter were $68 million or a negative impact to margins of 80 basis points and $0.10 to earnings. This charge was lower than our anticipated range of $125 million to $175 million in Q3 due to factors that impacted the timing of actions that are being pushed into Q4. The carryover impact of higher raw material logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $25 million, or a negative 30 basis points impact to operating margins and $0.03 to earnings. Foreign currency translation was a positive 0.6% impact to total adjusted sales. This resulted in a $0.01 tailwind to earnings per share. Last year's food safety divestiture and the reconsolidation of aero technologies resulted in a net year-on-year tailwind of 10 basis points to margins and no impact to earnings.Finally, other financial items decreased earnings by a net $0.02 per share year-on-year. In summary, our team's focus on driving productivity, executing restructuring actions, and controlling spending continues to yield results. These actions drove meaningful year-on-year and sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins. Please turn to slide seven. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up 39% year-on-year, with a conversion of 130%, up 360 basis points, versus last year's Q3. This year-on-year improvement was driven by an ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory. Inventory was down over $200 million sequentially and $550 million year-on-year as we benefit from the power of daily management and data and data analytics to speed up inventory terms.As always, there is more we can do and will do to continue to realize benefits from our actions as we move forward. Adjusted capital expenditures were $367 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in growth, productivity, and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividends. Net debt at the end of Q3 stood at $10.8 billion, a reduction of 11% year-on-year. Our business segments continue their long history of robust cash flow generation. In addition, our proven access to capital markets, along with the anticipated one-time dividend from the spin of health care at leverage of three to three and a half times EBITDA and 19.9% retained stake will provide additional financial flexibility. This, combined with our existing strong capital structure, provides us with the ability to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders, and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters.Now, please turn to slide nine for our business group performance. Starting with our safety and industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 5.8% organically, this result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $130 million, or 4.3 percentage points, due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator decline and exit of our operations in Russia. Excluding this, Q3 adjusted organic sales were down 1.5%. Personal safety was down high single digits due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator comp. Excluding disposable respirators, personal safety was up high single digits organically. Closure and masking continued to be impacted by lower packaging and shipping activity, and industrial adhesive and tapes by end-market softness in electronics.Abrasives, electrical markets, and automotive aftermarket declined versus last year's strong comparisons. And finally, organic growth in our roofing granules business was up high single digits. Adjusted operating income was $708 million or up 5% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 25.7%, up 250 basis points year-on-year and up 350 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year improvement in margins was mainly driven by ongoing productivity actions, restructuring benefits, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume and restructuring costs. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 10, which posted Q3 adjusted sales of $1.9 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 1.8% year-on-year, largely due to expected weakness in electronics.Our electronics business experienced a year-on-year mid-single-digit decline in adjusted organic sales as semiconductor and data center end market demand continues to remain soft. We are starting to see signs of stabilization in consumer electronics end market. However, we are closely monitoring demand trends as we head into the upcoming holiday season. Our auto OEM business had a strong quarter, increasing approximately 16% year-on-year versus a low single-digit global car and light truck build, as we continue to gain penetration on automotive platforms. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics, commercial solutions and transportation safety both declined mid-single digits year-on-year, mainly driven by weakness in China, while Advanced Materials grew low single digits.Transportation and Electronics delivered $494 million in adjusted operating income, up 21% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 26.3%, up 460 basis points year-on-year and up 650 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, restructuring benefits, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volumes and restructuring costs. Looking at our health care business on Slide 11, Q3 sales were $2.1 billion, with organic growth up 2.4% versus last year. Organic sales in oral care were up high single digits year-on-year and medical solutions grew low single digits organically, including continued impact from lower post-COVID-related bio-pharma demand.Health Information Systems declined low single digits due to tighter hospital budgets. As procedure volumes continue to improve and hospital budgets stabilize, we are confident in the long-term outlook of this business. Health Care's third quarter operating income was $460 million or up 2% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22.2%, up 50 basis points year-on-year and up sequentially 240 basis points. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, restructuring benefits strong spending discipline and price. These benefits were partially offset by restructuring costs. Finally, on Slide 12, our Consumer business posted third quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 7.2% year-on-year as discretionary spending trends on hard-line categories remains subdued.The back-to-school season was soft and rising interest rates continue to impact the housing market and related spending. Consumers' third quarter operating income was $269 million, down 10% compared to last year with operating margins of 20.5%, down 70 basis points year-on-year, however, were up 230 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year decline in margins was driven by headwinds from lower sales volumes and restructuring costs. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from productivity actions, restructuring and strong spending discipline and price. That concludes our remarks on the third quarter. Please turn to Slide 14 for an update on our full year's expectations. Our strong third quarter performance shows the results of the significant actions we have put in place this year to generate better productivity yield and efficiency from our supply chain, drive simplification, manage costs and deliver for our customers in an uncertain macro environment.As a result, we are raising our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow conversion guidance. We now expect full year adjusted earnings in the range of $8.95 to $9.15 versus our prior range of $8.60 to $9.10. We are also updating our full year adjusted free cash flow conversion to be in a forecasted range of 100% to 110% versus 90% to 100% previously. Based on our year-to-date performance, we expect full year adjusted organic growth to be down approximately 3% versus our prior guidance to be at the lower end of flat to minus 3%. This updated expectation includes an incremental headwind of $50 million from continued softness in disposable respirator demand. We now estimate a full year sales decline for disposable respirators of approximately $600 million versus $550 million previously.Looking ahead to the implied fourth quarter, we expect end market trends to be consistent with Q3. Hence, we anticipate fourth quarter adjusted sales to be in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion, taking into consideration normal seasonality with fewer sales days due to holidays. Fourth quarter pre-tax restructuring charges are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $120 million, incorporating the timing impact I mentioned earlier, with pre-tax benefits of $145 million to $195 million. Taken together, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.33. To wrap up, we are very focused on our priorities by driving improved performance through strong operational execution, progressing on our restructuring actions and spending discipline successfully spinning off health care and reducing risk by managing litigation exposures.At the same time, we are positioning 3M for the future as we prioritize the most attractive markets, invest to support continued innovation and capitalize on emerging opportunities. We expect our actions will continue to build momentum and drive long-term improvement in our organic growth margins and cash flow performance into the future. As we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and a more focused 3M, and I remain confident in our future. Our solid third quarter is a direct result of the hard work of 3M employees. I want to thank them for their dedication and focus as they continue to deliver in partnership with our suppliers for customers and shareholders. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.See also 12 Best Telecom Stocks To Buy Right Now and 10 Fastest Growing Auto Stocks to Buy.Q&A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question.Scott Davis: Good morning, Mike, Monish, and Bruce. I haven't been able to say this in a while, but a pretty solid, complete quarter overall, so some progress there. But, guys, I want to back up a little bit. What are the remaining steps to get health care spin complete? Any big hurdles still remaining?Michael Roman: Yes, Scott, I would say the team continues to make very good progress. And so we don't see any hurdles ahead of us. There's a lot of work to do to get ready for the spin and so we've got work to do, getting ready for each step of that process. As we talked about in my remarks, we named the CEO, and we're adding to the leadership team and getting that built out. So that's really an important foundation. We have the Board Chair named and continue to work on filling out the Board. So those are important steps. I don't see -- the team has given us great confidence that we're going to continue to progress. And we're on track for the timing that we talked about in early 2024 and see ourselves getting there successfully.Importantly, for us, it's -- much of it is and we've talked about, it's about getting ready for the spin of health care, it's also about getting ready to stand up 3M as a stand-alone Company with a health care spin being completed. So we're putting focus there. And even what we talked about in the quarter that really driving the priorities that we are talking about, the execution in our operational execution is an important part of getting ready for 3M for the spin as well, and we're making good progress there, as you noted.Monish Patolawala: Just process-wise to add to Mike's comments, the teams are working through system changes, standing up legal entities and as well as all the regulatory filings, Scott, that we need to do, and that's what everyone is focused on from the health care side.Scott Davis: That's helpful. So Mike, just taking your comments a little further, at the new 3M, do you envision a new 3M or you can kind of run at lower levels of CapEx, lower levels of even potentially R&D as a percent of sales. And the knock on 3M was always that it costs a lot of money to drive a point of growth and sometimes with the incrementals that worked out well. But in down cycles, that certainly did not work out well. But is there a new vision in 3M, I should say, that you can run at kind of more productive, efficient levels of CapEx and R&D?Michael Roman: Yes. Scott, there's a couple of dimensions to the answer to your question. The first starts with what we've been talking about. We announced a restructuring back in Q1, and that was really coming from what we had learned as we operated our businesses and we looked at where we were going with our supply chains in the face of some of the challenges in supply chains globally. And it was really behind that was an expectation that we could drive greater productivity, improvement in our execution, stronger performance, improved margins. And so that was really the foundation of that restructuring. And so I think part of the answer to your question is we took those decisions to lean out the center of the Company, simplify our supply chain, streamline our go-to-market models.Those are a foundation for the future of 3M. And those are -- you can see starting to demonstrate that we can drive improved financial performance for the Company. And that's -- we expect that to be a foundation for the future as well. I even talked about this is with that performance starting to build some momentum, we can accelerate how we view the future. And then you are talking about investing in growth and innovation and productivity and sustainability. And we'll continue to be our capital allocation, first priority is going to be investing in organic growth in R&D and CapEx. And really, thinking of and targeting high-growth market spaces, places where we can differentiate ourselves with our innovation capabilities where we can be aligned to emerging market trends.So I think that how we prioritize that investment is going to be aligned with where we see that ability to make a difference. So both are important foundations for the future.Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.Andrew Obin: Yes. Good morning. Just a question on electronics. It's been a headwind for a while. What KPIs are you looking at? When do you think -- and I think you said that was broadly in line with expectations. But when do you see the light at the end of the tunnel? When does it bottom -- what does it take for this business to bottom?Michael Roman: Yes, Andrew, I would say we came through third quarter. We still saw as we said soft end markets for electronics, and that's consumer electronics, it's into semiconductor. It's into a big part of our -- what we have as a focus in our customers and electronics. When we look ahead, there's some uncertainty, we're starting to see, as Monish said, electronics stabilize. I think that really reflects that we don't see it continuing to go down. It's starting to stabilize. There's some -- companies are talking about things getting better as they go forward. I would say we're watching it closely. We expect Q4 to look a lot like Q3 in our end markets, and I would say electronics included. So we're watching what we always watch.Our customers are large electronics customers in consumer electronics and semiconductor associated with data centers and those are the -- that's where we're going to be taking the lead from where we see demand going, where we see market performance going, when we see the market improve. We'll take the lead from them.Monish Patolawala: Just another data point for you, Andrew, at the end of second quarter, we had said that the way we predicted electronics was the amount of negative Vs quarter-on-quarter would get better. So if you compare us to the first half and the amount we were down year-on-year versus the third quarter, we are less down. It doesn't mean we are not down, but that's another point that Mike was trying to make is that's where we are starting to see some signs of stabilization. But as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we'll have to just watch how the holiday season plays out.Andrew Obin: Got you. And just a follow-up question on health care. I appreciate that you guys are doing a lot of sort of sort of accounting, et cetera, et cetera. But you have done the separations in the past. And I guess the question I have, any thoughts, as Bryan has joined the Company, I know in the past, there's been headlines about Health Information System being separated. I know there are other sort of businesses inside health care. Any thought about sort of maybe repositioning the portfolio as particularly as Bryan came on board, repositioned the portfolio for sort of future as a stand-alone Company.Michael Roman: Yes, Andrew, going back to really how did we think about the strategy to spin out health care. And one of the important questions was do we see health care as a leading health care technology Company attractive to shareholders with a great future. And that portfolio of businesses, the answer for us was yes. And that the -- the best way to create that value was to stand it up as a stand-alone Company and the portfolio work we had done even over time as part of 3M position it to be a successful stand-alone Company. And each of the businesses play an important role there. Now it is going to be an independent Company. We'll have a new CEO and a Board and they will develop the strategies for how they think about creating the greatest value driving growth for that business, thinking about how to really manage that portfolio of businesses as they go forward.So we see it as being ready to stand forward as a leader and are really confident in the leadership that will take the Company as a stand-alone.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.Joseph Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can we start just on the restructuring, the benefits and the push out a little bit of the expenses? Just -- it seems like you're running ahead of schedule on the benefits. So I'd love to get any color about where this is. What you see coming in better than expected? And then also just on the push-out on the cost into 4Q, just what were some of the reasons for why the costs are getting pushed out from 3Q to 4Q?Monish Patolawala: Yes. So I'll just start, again, as a reminder, Joe, the total benefits for this program over the period of the program is $700 million to $900 million, with costs approximately of $700 million to $900 million. And coming into the year, we had said for 2023, we would see benefits in the ranges of $400 million to $450 million of benefits and equal offsetting charges. So when you look year-to-date, we are, I would say largely on track for the year, we still believe will be in the $400 million to $450 million of benefits, which will get offset by cost of $400 million to $450 million. So the teams have done a really nice job of continuing to execute. There are multiple pieces to this program. One was corporate simplification.The second was streamlining our supply chain. And third was making sure that we are closer to our customers in our business group units. And all three of these programs are running well on track. As regards to just timing from Q3 to Q4, I would say nothing big. We operate in multiple countries, as you know, and we wanted to make sure we follow all rules and regulations in those countries. And so some items dropped from Q3 to Q4, and we had a couple of other small investments that we had to make in Q3. They're just based on all the work the teams are doing, we just felt better to do it in Q4, so nothing major. So still pretty much largely on track, $400 million to $450 million of benefits for the year and $700 million to $900 million for the program.Joseph Ritchie: Got it. Okay. Great. That's helpful, Monish. And then I guess -- I know it's probably too early to think about 2024. But if you kind of think through like the price/cost equation from here on out, it seems like raw materials are becoming less and less of a headwind for you guys. Can you maybe just provide any type of framework for 2024 and ultimately, like how you think about both price and what you're seeing from a raw mat perspective?Monish Patolawala: So, I'll just start first, Joe, by 2024 is a little ways away. So I think our first focus is just getting Q4 done, getting the teams continuing to focus on our priorities. You've seen what our teams have done. So we continue to execute on our priorities. You've seen we have delivered a solid Q3. We have taken guidance up for the whole year. We're gaining momentum, and we want the team to continue to focus on doing that getting 2023 closed out. So when we get into 2024 and Q4 2023 earnings call, we'll definitely give you an update on 2024. To answer your question on deflation and price, I'll start with deflation. I'll start by saying, first of all, the headwinds that we have seen or the carryover headwinds are approximately $25 million in the quarter, which we called out, which was very similar to Q2.When you look at overall market and material, I would say we are seeing more disinflation than deflation. When you think about places where energy is still a little more -- is still inflationary, downstream materials are still inflationary and then labor is still sticky from an inflation perspective. Where we have seen some benefits is upstream chemicals and logistics and the teams have taken advantage of that. But I would say more importantly, I don't think the teams are just focused on material cost, they are more focused on saying, how do we drive overall cost down in the factories, whether it is driving yield and efficiency, whether it is dual sourcing, whether it is making sure we have alternate materials. That's what Peter Gibbons and the team is working.And the work that they have done through this year is clearly evident in the results that you're seeing. So that team has done a very nice job. And then when it comes to price, I would tell you, we came into the quarter -- into the year, we said low single digits price increase. That's what we are -- as of right now, we are on track with pretty much the same range. And Joe, as you know, you've followed 3M longer than I have. This is not a formula-based pricing. We are very thoughtful about it. We look at it market by market, product by product, and we make sure that the price that we are charging our customers is a representation of the value that we -- that our customers get. And I would say, if you leave 2024 aside for a moment, long term, 3M has always had a very good price/cost equation because of the value that we add to our customers.And I don't see that changing. And I believe that with the innovation that we bring with the customer focus that we have that, that equation remains.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. You may proceed with your question.Christopher Snyder: Thank you. One thing that has really stood out to us over the last couple of quarters is the underlying margin improvement of the business. if we ex out restructuring spend and savings, we see an operating margin on the underlying business of roughly 22% this quarter, first, less than 21% in Q2 and like a mid-'18 in Q1. So a very strong ramp here. Can you just talk about what's driving that outside of the restructuring, why is the underlying business seeing so much margin momentum?Monish Patolawala: So I would say, first, Chris, it's a huge thanks to the 3Mers who have been focused on their priorities. The priorities, as Mike mentioned, driving performance across all of 3M, spinning out health care, reducing risk by managing litigation is all starting to show up in the results. To your point, even if you exclude our restructuring costs and benefits, the margin rate is -- has shown a pretty good ramp. And that's driven, I would say, by two or three things. One is continued execution in the supply chain, with some of the restructuring that we have made and the supply chain is definitely more agile. We are also using a lot of data and data analytics. We have also learned through the pandemic on how to continue to operate our supply chain.So number one, you're starting to see the benefit of the improved yield and efficiency, you're able to take longer runs to as material gets better. Secondly, the team has been very thoughtful in proactive cost management to the extent where they saw there were places they could invest, they have; to the extent where we had lower volumes, we have managed to control cost. Third is we have had a relentless focus on working capital with inventory, and you're seeing that from a cash conversion basis. So I would just say it's continued good, strong operating performance that you're starting to see. And then as you add on the benefits that you get from the restructuring and once the cost goes away, which we have said this program will take approximately two years to complete out, you can see the overall, long-term benefits from the margin rate that you're going to get from better operating performance as well as better restructuring benefits.At the same time, you've got to keep in mind that we are that -- the teams are going to continue to watch this in the fourth quarter. It's an uncertain macro. But I'm very confident with what we're doing that the execution is there, but there's always more we can do, and we'll keep trying to drive more and more execution as we go.Christopher Snyder: I appreciate that. And maybe kind of taking that and bridging to the Q4 guide. It seems to us by our math, that you're kind of guiding underlying operating margins ex restructuring to something like 19% down from the almost 22% this quarter. I know revenue is down, but it seems to suggest a very sharp decremental. Can you just maybe talk about what's causing that margin step down? Because it feels like a lot of the improvements, whether it's supply chain or price cost are sustainable. Thank you.Monish Patolawala: Yes. Chris, again, depends on the math. I'll just start with margin rates in total. When we started the year or we came into the year, we had said margin rates for the year are going to be around 19%. At the end of Q2, we said margin rates are going between 19.5% to 20% for the year. And now based on where we are with the midpoint of our guide, our margin rate will be approximately 20%. So when you back into it, the fourth quarter is higher than the 19.5% that you have, it's somewhere in that 20.5% to 21% for the fourth quarter. And just to keep in mind, the reason you see this decremental. One is, of course, the restructuring is higher in Q4 versus Q3, plus it's higher of -- the midpoint is $95 million to $100 million of restructuring on a year-over-year basis, if you're doing year-over-year decrementals.The second piece to keep in mind is, in general, revenue in 3M drops from Q3 to Q4, you have less billing days or less business days in Q4. That's why our revenue guide, which is going from $8 billion, it goes down to between $7.6 billion and $7.7 billion, which is basically saying the underlying macro trends are the same. It's just lower billing days or lower business days, which also puts an impact. If you look at the history of 3M, Chris, and you look at Q3 to Q4, you will always see a pretty sharp decline from Q3 to Q4 in margin rate. And that's mainly driven by just the lower volume because of the less business days that come into Q4. Hopefully, that answered your question.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Andrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys. So, Monish, I think at a conference a month ago, you had lowered your revenue guidance a bit and you sort of report $8 billion -- I think you had $7.9 billion to $8 billion. So maybe you can talk about the cadence of revenues for the quarter. Did any of your businesses pick up in September here in October? Are you just being conservative at the time? And then how are you thinking about the impact of higher rates on your businesses?Monish Patolawala: So I'll start by saying at that moment in time, what we saw is what we told you all, which we felt was in that $7.9 billion to $8 billion. There Was uncertainty in electronics, consumer and China, I would say, thanks to all the focus the teams have on taking care of customers, we were able to get to the high end of our range of $8 billion. I would say the same trends, Andy, pretty much stayed through the quarter. Electronics pretty much was where we thought it was going to be. China continued to remain weak and so did consumer retail. As Mike mentioned and so I have in my prepared remarks, we are seeing electronic stabilizing. We are watching for the fourth quarter what the holiday trends will bring for consumer retail.Back-to-school was softer than we expected. And then China, again, I would say is we are -- it's pretty much the trends we expected in China. Overall, for the fourth quarter, you'll see us having revenue of $7.6 billion to $7.7 million, which is again just driven by the fact you have less business days. On the other side, if you look at margin and you look at what the teams have done, the teams have continued to be very good on an operating execution perspective. We have continued to drive proactive cost control. We've done that in Q3. We'll continue to do that in Q4. And as a result, we were able to beat the 225 to 240. I had said in that conference a few months ago, and then we have raised totally a guide from 860 to 910 to 895 to 915. And then the other point, Andy, that's another bright spot is the cash conversion.The teams have done a marvelous job managing inventory, 130% free cash flow conversion in the third quarter, which has allowed us to raise our total year guide of free cash flow -- adjusted free cash flow conversion from 200% to 110% from 90% to 100%. So overall, the team is focused on operating execution.Andrew Kaplowitz: Monish, if I can follow up on that, the cash conversion target raise. Maybe talk about your efforts. I know you talked about improving digitization at the Company, it seems like you're focused on digitization inventories having impact. So maybe you can talk about the confidence in generating higher cash conversion going forward, sort of the duration of these improvements as you go forward in '24 and beyond.Monish Patolawala: Yes. From the day of coming here, Andy, I've said working capital is a great opportunity for 3M. And through the pandemic, unfortunately, we had to build inventory levels and most companies did just to make sure we took care of our customers. And our first priority was always to take care of our customers. So we made sure we had enough inventory. As two things, as supply chains are stabilizing, number one, but more importantly, the execution that the teams are doing using data and data analytics and not -- and what I mean by that is not just going and using analytics, but being able to visualize by looking at data, they are able to see where the inventory is better. They are able to get a better demand signal, which allows them to get a better manufacturing signal, which allows them to get a better supply signal to their suppliers.And then the third piece is with all the work that we have done through the restructuring, where we have got the supply chain streamlined and restructured so that it's more agile. All of that is playing itself out in the inventory that we are seeing. I would tell you, as I said in my prepared remarks, there's more to go here. There's more that we can keep driving in this space. And we are going to continue driving it because this is a great place where we can continue to generate very strong cash for 3M.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. What are you planning and assuming for the auto strike impact for 4Q?Michael Roman: Yes, Deane, so it's something we're watching very closely. We're -- as you know, we stay very close with the automotive OEMs, our key customers there. We are -- we haven't seen a significant impact on our business to date. And we continue to watch it closely. We're staying connected on what happens week-to-week and impacting our demand. But it's something that as part of -- an important part of our global automotive business, the automotive as we talked about in the quarter, had very good performance. We had 16% growth in the quarter, outgrowing build rates and that's the broader core of our automotive business, our auto electrification business is growing even faster. So it's an important part. It's had some impact but relatively small impact to this point. Again, we're watching it closely as we move ahead.Deane Dray: Got it. And then you mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, the back-to-school sales were weak. Can you quantify that just maybe year-over-year? And then how does this set up for holiday sales with consumer being weak, higher rates? What's the assumption there as well?Michael Roman: Yes, Dean, I probably would point you back at some of the data out there about year-over-year spend back-to-school being down per student. There's a number of metrics out there. For us, our category broadly in consumer is exposed to like shifting discretionary spend. So that continues to be part of the consumer story. So it wasn't back-to-school story, only back-to-school was muted. We didn't see the strong replenishment cycles that we would have seen in a stronger back-to-school. So I think we confirmed the data that's out there. And as we look ahead, we're -- I would say we're just looking at the uncertainty around what happens for the holiday season as well. And so we'll be monitoring that. And again, there's a broader story around consumer, retail for us, the shift of spending from discretionary products into areas like food and I would say, experienced kinds of spending, that trend has continued.So those are both underlying some of the performance that we saw in consumer in the quarter and how we're thinking about it into Q4.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.Stephen Tusa: Hi, good morning. Could you just give just an update total expected now inflation kind of carryover for the year? I know you mentioned it in the second quarter. Is that unchanged relative to what you had said before? I think it was like $150 million? Maybe that changed?Monish Patolawala: No change, Steve.Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then I guess, low single digits for the year on pricing. So that's kind of like a mid-single-digit volume decline. That kind of feels already recessionary. Things seem like very stable for you guys revenue-wise. How much of that negative 5% do you think is a function of destocking versus trend line on demand? And then just one last one for the fourth quarter. How much of that sequential sales decline are you expecting from electronics seasonality?Michael Roman: Yes. So Steve, maybe just thinking about the -- take the channel dynamic first, if you want. I would say -- when we look across the channel where we're seeing some destocking as in industrial channels, and that's really -- I think we talked about that last quarter, too, as supply chain performance has improved and stabilized. We're seeing the industrial channels shorten up their replenishment cycles. And so they're managing their inventory maybe back to more normal levels prior to when we got hit with some of the supply chain disruption. So that's the one destocking effect. There is some destocking in consumer that played out. The biggest part of that played out over the last year, retailers focused pretty heavily on taking out inventory.That seems to have played out, although there's some of that with the soft demand that's continuing. So it's, I would say, the rest of it -- when I look across the channel, otherwise, it's pretty stable globally; maybe some adjustments in China in some of those same markets as we continue to see the macro looking for where the macro goes as we go forward. Looking as we move ahead, electronics, we talked about stabilizing. It's really, Monish pointed out, it's part of it's a year-over-year comp. Remember last year, third and fourth quarter, we saw a decline in the electronics end markets, and we saw that in our businesses. So that's part of the view that Q4 stabilizes that year-over-year comp gets a little more -- changes a little bit as we lap some of those earlier declines from the first half.So I would say, we're staying close to that holiday season and what happens. That's an important season for electronics, and we'll be watching that closely as we go into the quarter.Monish Patolawala: Steve, I'll just add. I'll just add -- I just wanted to add one more disposable respirators is down $600 million on a year-over-year basis. That's approximately 200 basis points of growth.Stephen Tusa: Right. So sorry, are you assuming kind of normal sequential seasonal decline in electronics, you are?Michael Roman: Yes. Well, in the broader business, we have seasonality. Some of that is normal end market cycles, but it's also billing days as well. We have the holiday season. So we see it sequentially from Q3 to Q4, we see that normal trend.Stephen Tusa: Right, which you've always had, of courseOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.Nigel Coe: Hi, good morning guys. So you can have too many electronics questions. So what's got my attention in Electronics is the sequential growth from 1Q through to 3Q has been quite sharp. I think 1Q was about 680. I think 3Q is a 750 or so. I mean I know some of its seasonality, et cetera. But it must give you a lot of confidence that as we go into 2024, that at least in the first half of the year, we should be -- that should be a nice tailwind to the business. So any thoughts on that?Michael Roman: Well, Nigel, I would say it's going to depend on the outlook as we get to 2024 for electronics and those key end markets that you're talking about it. And we've seen -- maybe that's part of the stabilization that we're seeing is the quarterly trend in electronics and against that year-over-year comparable is stabilizing in the second half. What will decide the performance in first quarter or first half of next year will really depend on the demand that we see. And some of that will come through the holiday season, but we'll be -- we'll come back at our Q4 earnings call and update on how we're looking at the first half of next year.Nigel Coe: Okay. That's great. And then I don't like to ask same macro questions necessarily, but you are pretty -- cycle, very channel-centric. The flash PMI for the U.S. was at 50 in October. Are you seeing more stabilization or maybe some sequential improvement in the U.S. relative to Europe and China?Michael Roman: Yes. I think Monish called out the performance in the U.S. was up slightly, and -- and that, I would say, mixed performance in our industrial businesses in the U.S., reflecting some areas of strength, but also some, I would say, caution and uncertainty around the broader economy. So I think we're seeing the U.S. performing a little better, up slightly. And that's -- I would say that's in spite of the challenges that we've been talking about in consumer retail. So Safety and Industrial posted, I think, mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. in the quarter. So that's a good reflection on what we're seeing more broadly. And maybe that PMI is aligned to that. That PMI represents kind of a middle kind of expectation from the purchasing managersMonish Patolawala: Just only other thing Nigel I will add to Mike's comments is just in certain pockets, we are seeing customers managing inventory channel. And part of it is supply chains are definitely far more stable. So customers have lower lead times, so they're managing that in pockets.Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning, thank you very much. One quick question. I just wanted to circle back on your sort of pricing outlook as you see it because volumes have been soft for some time. Headline inflation in theory is easing. Traditionally, you do have price pressure in areas like electronics, just through nature of the industry. So I just wondered sort of what the comfort level was as you look into Q4 and early next year, that you can hold price kind of firm-wide at least flat at 3M? And whether there's been any change how you sort of go to market to push price just given the experience of inflation in the last couple of years?Monish Patolawala: Yes, Julian, I would just say the same thing that I said with another question before. The way I would just say long term, 3M has always been able to add value to its customers, and that is reflected in the pricing that it charges. We look at this not based on just a formula, but we look at it market by market, look at our competitive position and market by market, look at the value we add, and that's how we come up with our pricing that we go with. And I would say, based on the innovation and the value that we add to our customers, long term, I don't see that changing. In the short run, as you have seen, the Company has been able to manage inflation through price. And if needed, we'll continue doing that. But overall, right now, the teams are quite focused on delivering the fourth quarter, and then we'll see where long term goes this topic. It will be a function of demand, a function of inflation. So that's the way I look at it.Julian Mitchell: Understood. And then just to focus on a couple of markets within Safety and Industrial, but I guess had been pretty strong and most of the sort of rhetoric is fairly strong around them. But organically, you had a little bit of pressure at least or less growth in and that's the electrical markets and also automotive aftermarket. So I just wondered any color around those in terms of is it just kind of accelerated destocking distributors just holding off on orders for some reason? Any color at all on auto aftermarket and electrical?Michael Roman: Yes, Julian, I wouldn't -- we saw a little bit of destocking in electrical markets. That was one of the areas in industrial that we saw that impacting. And I would say our automotive aftermarket probably saw a little bit of adjustments given what we talked about and Monish highlighted that, improving supply chains, distribution and the channel are managing their inventories, their safety stock, so more in line with stable supply chain. So I think that's part of it. Those have both been seeing good market performance as we've gone through the year. I think again, we're watching closely the trends as we go into the end of the year. But really, it's, I think, reflects on the -- a little bit of destocking and also the end market demand.Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.Michael Roman: To wrap up, we continue to execute our strategies, delivering results in a challenging environment while positioning 3M for the future, prioritizing high-growth markets and geographies where 3M innovation can deliver the most impact. Thank you for joining us.Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

ABT,"['ABTeditorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)November 4, 2023 at 4:00 AM·6 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowABTWatchlistKey InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Abbott Laboratories fair value estimate is US$113Abbott Laboratories\' US$95.84 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Analyst price target for ABT is US$116, which is 3.1% above our fair value estimateToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today\'s value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Abbott Laboratories The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second \'steady growth\' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today\'s dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.42bUS$8.72bUS$8.97bUS$9.40bUS$9.70bUS$9.99bUS$10.3bUS$10.5bUS$10.8bUS$11.0bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.20%Est @ 2.90%Est @ 2.70%Est @ 2.55%Est @ 2.45%Est @ 2.38% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$7.9kUS$7.6kUS$7.4kUS$7.2kUS$7.0kUS$6.7kUS$6.5kUS$6.2kUS$6.0kUS$5.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$68bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business\'s cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country\'s GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year \'growth\' period, we discount future cash flows to today\'s value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.2%) = US$246bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$246b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$128bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$196b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$95.8, the company appears about fair value at a 15% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don\'t have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company\'s future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company\'s potential performance. Given that we are looking at Abbott Laboratories as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we\'ve used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.916. Beta is a measure of a stock\'s volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Abbott LaboratoriesStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won\'t be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It\'s not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

NARI delivered earnings per share (EPS) of 5 cents in the third quarter of 2023 against the year-ago period’s loss of 19 cents per share. However, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a breakeven EPS.Revenues in DetailInari Medical registered revenues of $126.4 million in the third quarter, up 31.4% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6%.Q3 HighlightsOn the third quarter earnings call, Inari Medical’s management confirmed that 68% of its revenues were derived from the sale of FlowTriever Systems and 32% from the sale of ClotTriever and other systems.On the same call, management also continued to make progress across the six products that are in full market release in the second half of 2023. Three of these products, REVCORE, InThrill and ProTrieve, add direct incremental revenue opportunities. Management also confirmed gaining good initial traction and is receiving excellent clinical feedback across all three products.Per management, Inari Medical witnessed another quarter of record case and revenue production outside of the United States. Its performance was driven primarily by increased adoption in Western Europe, complemented by solid case growth in its early-stage markets in Latin America, Canada and Asia-Pacific. The company continues to make good progress in both China and Japan and anticipates beginning to treat patients in both these markets in 2024. Management expects its international business could represent greater than 20% of total revenues over time on the back of unmet needs.During the reported quarter, NARI launched two new products — RevCore and T16 Curve catheter — both targeting patients with venous thromboembolism.Inari Medical, Inc.

The company continued to make impressive progress with respect to its product portfolio, which saw robust product adoption. Geographical performances were also impressive.

The uptick in locum tenens revenues and Language interpretation services revenues was impressive. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the stock.Management confirmed that its definitive agreement to acquire MSDR will likely bolster AMN Healthcare’s presence in the robust locum tenens market. On the earnings call, management confirmed that the company had strengthened its ability to deliver multifaceted tech-enabled workforce solutions to simplify labor management and provide a variety of options for making the labor force more flexible and cost effective. Additionally, management believes that clients would be able to access AMN Healthcare’s full set of solutions via our better-integrated sales and service organization. These look promising for the stock.However, AMN Healthcare’s dismal top-line and bottom-line performances were disappointing. The decline in all the segmental revenues during the reported quarter was worrying. The contraction of the adjusted operating margin raises our apprehension about the stock. AMN Healthcare expects to register a decline in its overall top line and all its segments in the fourth quarter of 2023, which is concerning.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAMN Healthcare currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Abbott Laboratories ABT, DexCom, Inc.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this maker of infant formula, medical devices and drugs have returned -0.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.8% change. The Zacks Medical - Products industry, to which Abbott belongs, has lost 3.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Abbott is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.44 points to a change of -16.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.62 indicates a change of +3.9% from what Abbott is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Abbott.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Abbott, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.14 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $40.01 billion and $41.55 billion estimates indicate -8.4% and +3.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAbbott reported revenues of $10.14 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.6%. EPS of $1.14 for the same period compares with $1.15 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.6%. The EPS surprise was +3.64%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Abbott is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Abbott. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Many people living with diabetes aren\'t aware of this incredible life-changing technology and Abbott\'s efforts to make it accessible. The goal of \'Countdown at a Crossroads\' is to change that - and I am energized to help by fostering awareness.""The World is at a Diabetes CrossroadsThere are more than half a billion adults across the world living with diabetes and this number is only predicted to rise1. Yet only 1% of them are using technology like FreeStyle Libre, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system3, signifying that they are not aware of or do not have access to this technology.Story continuesCGM technology provides real-time data to help a person see how food, activity and medicine can have an impact on their glucose levels, with the additional benefit of improving their health by reducing their hemoglobin A1C4. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lowering your A1C can lower a person\'s risk of complications from diabetes such as nerve damage, eye problems and heart disease.More people are using medications like GLP-1s to improve their glycemic control or help with weight loss. In a newly published analysis from Abbott, data has shown that these drugs can work better with CGMs by not only providing weight loss but also helping people living with diabetes create positive, long-term behavior changes to assist in managing their condition.Making Critical Diabetes Technology More AccessibleAbbott has taken steps at every stage of the design process to make FreeStyle Libre systems the most cost-efficient. Priced at 70% less than other CGM systems, FreeStyle Libre is the most affordable5 option for the one in 10 Americans6 who are living with diabetes.""We purposefully made FreeStyle Libre technology to be accessible and affordable,"" said Jared Watkin, senior vice president of Abbott\'s diabetes care business. ""However, even with our millions of users, we know that continuous glucose monitors are still not being used by the vast majority of people who can benefit from them. We\'re working hard to spread awareness and improve access, and we hope that our critical innovation can play a part in slowing the diabetes epidemic.""CGMs have become the standard of care for people with Type 1 diabetes, yet up to 95% of people living with diabetes in America have Type 2 diabetes7, where approximately less than 10% of people use CGM technology8 - either because they are not aware or do not have insurance coverage. In several studies, CGMs have been proven to help people living with Type 2 diabetes significantly reduce diabetes-related hospitalizations while also enabling them to control their diabetes without adding insulin therapy to their treatment routine9.Abbott will continue to work with health systems, payors and government agencies in the U.S. and around the world to expand reimbursement for CGMs so that all people living with diabetes can get access.Countdown at a CrossroadsMirroring the staggering reality that a new person is diagnosed with diabetes every 23 seconds in the United States6, the Crossroads structure on display at the Oculus Center in New York City on Nov. 1 will generate a different face of someone impacted by diabetes every 23 seconds. Additionally, visitors can scan a QR code featured on the installation or visit www.Crossroads.Abbott to learn more about diabetes, the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring technology, and read personal stories of patients positively impacted by FreeStyle Libre\'s transformative technology.With a mere 1% of those globally living with diabetes utilizing CGMs to manage their condition3, Abbott is recognizing the other 99% who could benefit from this vital tool. For every person who visits www.Crossroads.Abbott during November\'s National Diabetes Awareness Month, a $0.99 donation* will be provided to the American Diabetes Association\'s Health Equity Now program.""Our ongoing partnership with Abbott underscores the importance of making diabetes care and management accessible,"" said Charles ""Chuck"" Henderson, chief executive officer of the American Diabetes Association. ""We appreciate Abbott\'s support to increase awareness of health disparities and implement consumer access solutions during this critical time in the diabetes community. It takes all of us working together to end diabetes.""To learn more about \'Countdown at a Crossroads,\' visit www.Crossroads.Abbott and follow Abbott on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.The FreeStyle Libre portfolio is the number one sensor-based glucose monitoring system in the world10 changing the lives of more than 5 million people across more than 60 countries8 by providing breakthrough technology that is accessible and affordable5.About AbbottAbbott is a global healthcare leader that helps people live more fully at all stages of life.

AVNS reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of 30 cents, up 25% year over year. The bottom line topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.GAAP loss per share from continuing operations in the quarter under review was 19 cents against the year-ago period’s EPS of 23 cents.RevenuesRevenues grossed $171.3 million in the reported quarter, down 0.6% year over year. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8%.Per management, the top line was hampered by lower hyaluronic acid portfolio (HA) sales. Lower revenues from the Pain Management and Recovery portfolio also weighed on the top line. However, this was offset by a higher volume in the Digestive Health portfolio and slightly favorable pricing and foreign currency translation effects.Excluding currency and the impact of products no longer sold, organic growth was flat.Segmental AnalysisAvanos provides a portfolio of innovative product offerings that focus on Pain Management and Recovery and Digestive Health.Pain Management and Recovery’s net revenues of $76.3 million decreased 11.7% year over year on a reported basis. At constant exchange rate (CER), revenues were down 10%. Although the segment benefited from Diros revenues, the negative impact of foreign exchange and Avanos’ previously-announced decision to discontinue certain low-growth, low-margin products dragged the revenues. Management also confirmed witnessing continued softness across the Game Ready and HA product categories during the reported quarter. This figure compares to our third-quarter projection of $69.7 million.Digestive Health’s net revenues of $95 million improved 10.6% year over year. At CER, revenues were up nearly 10.5%. The business saw continued strong execution for NeoMed. Avanos also recorded continued expansion of its U.S. CORTRAK standard of care offering. This figure compares to our third-quarter projection of $86 million.Story continuesAvanos Medical, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAvanos Medical, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAvanos Medical, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Avanos Medical, Inc. QuoteMargin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, Avanos’ gross profit fell 4.7% to $95.5 million. The gross margin contracted 240 basis points (bps) to 55.8%.Selling and general expenses rose 0.5% to $78.7 million. Research and development expenses decreased 14.1% year over year to $6.1 million. Adjusted operating expenses of $84.8 million decreased 0.7% year over year.Adjusted operating profit totaled $10.7 million, reflecting a 27.7% decline from the prior-year quarter’s level. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter contracted 234 bps to 6.2%.Financial UpdateThe company exited third-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents worth $107.1 million compared with $81.8 million at the end of second quarter. Total debt at the third-quarter end was $264.5 million compared with $209.5 million at the second-quarter end.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of third-quarter 2023 totaled $19.7 million compared with $57.2 million in the prior-year period.GuidanceAvanos has reiterated its 2023 continuing operations guidance.The company continues to estimate its revenues for the full year in the range of $675 million-$685 million.Avanos continues to anticipate 2023 adjusted EPS between $1.05 and $1.15. The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $1.14.Our TakeAvanos’ ended the third quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. Its continued strength in the Digestive Health segment in the quarter was encouraging. The robust growth in NeoMed and CORTRAK was promising. On the earnings call, management confirmed that the early performance of Avanos’ newly acquired Trident product line has been solid. Management is also upbeat about the U.S. market launch, which commenced recently. This raises our optimism about the stock.Management also confirmed during the earnings call that it anticipates a continued reduction in supply-chain disruptions and strong demand for Avanos’ products. This also looks promising for the stock.Yet, Avanos’ year-over-year decline in the top line and lower revenues from the Pain Management and Recovery segment were disappointing. Management also confirmed during the earnings call that its efforts to reduce inventory negatively impacted fixed cost absorption. The company’s third-quarter performance was also hampered by the ongoing inflationary pressure on electronic components. These raise our apprehension. The contraction of both margins does not bode well.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAvanos currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Abbott Laboratories ABT, DexCom, Inc. DXCM and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.Abbott, carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy), reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted EPS of $1.14, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6%.

Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter contracted 257 bps to 15%.Financial PositionQuidelOrtho exited third-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $149.3 million compared with $178.6 million at the end of second quarter. Total debt (including short-term debt) at the end of third-quarter 2023 was $2.47 billion compared with $2.52 billion at the second-quarter end.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of third-quarter 2023 was $199.8 million compared with $715.9 million a year ago.GuidanceQuidelOrtho has reiterated its financial outlook for 2023.Total revenues are continued to be expected to lie in the range of $2.88 billion-$3.08 billion (down 29-24% a CER). The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.97 billion.Non-respiratory revenues are continued to be expected between $2.27 billion and $2.31 billion (up 5-6.5% at CER from 2022 levels).Respiratory revenues for the full year are continued to be expected to lie in the range of $610 million-$775 million. Per management, from the fourth quarter onward, QuidelOrtho will be including COVID-19 revenues as part of its overall respiratory business as it is in an endemic state.Adjusted EPS is continued to be expected to lie between $4.85 and $5.30. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $4.90.Our TakeQuidelOrtho ended the third quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. An uptick in the company’s Non-Respiratory revenues was impressive. The company registered robust revenues from its Labs and TM segments and China and Other regions, which were encouraging. QuidelOrtho also recorded strong revenue growth in the EMEA region on a reported basis, which buoys optimism.The company also recorded solid revenues from its Instrument and Recurring revenue categories, which were promising. The continued uptick in Sofia instruments and growth in QuidelOrtho’s integrated installed base and automation were encouraging.In September, QuidelOrtho received a CLIA Waiver from the FDA, which applies to its new Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA (fluorescent immunoassay). The test, intended for prescription use only, can be used in CLIA-waived point-of-care settings. This looked promising for the stock.However, dismal top-line and bottom-line results were disappointing. Lower Respiratory revenues during the quarter were also not promising. The decline in its POC and MDx segments and geographically in North America was discouraging. The decline in QuickVue revenues was also worrying. The contraction of both margins also does not bode well.Zacks Rank and Key PicksQuidelOrtho currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Abbott Laboratories ABT, DexCom, Inc. DXCM and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.Abbott, carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy), reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted EPS of $1.14, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6%.

Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system\'s ""Value"" category.

ANF is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.53. This compares to its industry\'s average Forward P/E of 14.28.

ANF\'s P/CF compares to its industry\'s average P/CF of 13.86. Over the past 52 weeks, ANF\'s P/CF has been as high as 13.11 and as low as 4.21, with a median of 9.84.The Gap (GPS) may be another strong Retail - Apparel and Shoes stock to add to your shortlist.

ANF recently overtook the 20-day moving average, and this suggests a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a well-liked trading tool because it provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. Additionally, short-term traders find this SMA very beneficial, as it smooths out short-term price trends and shows more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.Similar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend.ANF has rallied 9.6% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. This combination suggests ANF could be on the verge of another move higher.The bullish case solidifies once investors consider ANF's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 2 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.Investors may want to watch ANF for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Whether it be missed opportunities or selling quality stocks too soon, we’ve all been embarrassed at least a time or two.There’s no shame in the occasional failure as it’s how we learn. Particularly in an environment such as the stock market, it’s simply impossible to be right all of the time. Even professionals get it wrong a fair chunk; it’s the nature of the beast. Famously dubbed the “Great Humiliator”, the stock market attempts to fool the masses as often as possible.This recent downturn certainly has investors spooked, with the major U.S. indexes undercutting key support and technical levels. Markets remain in the midst of a multi-month correction; selling pressure accelerated last week, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 making new closing lows for the move. The Dow also fell back into negative territory on the year. Any rallies over the past few months have been short-lived and met by swift selling pressure.Still, a host of sectors are extremely oversold and ripe for a turnaround. And when we factor in that third-quarter earnings have come in above expectations, a potential setup for a year-end rally is in play.Q3 Earnings Surprise to the UpsideDespite the recent volatility, the Q3 earnings season results have been better than expected. Including the companies that reported through the end of last week, we now have results from 246 S&P 500 members (or 49.2% of the total membership). Earnings for these companies are up 6% from the same period last year on 2.1% higher revenues.More than 1,100 companies are set to report this week, including 159 S&P 500 members. Expectations for the third quarter have evolved in a bullish manner, with earnings now projected to grow 1.2% from the year-ago period on 1.2% higher revenues. This would mark the first quarter that earnings growth has turned positive after contracting during the last three consecutive quarters, potentially putting an end to the corporate earnings recession.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe major indices are clearly oversold and a snap-back rally could happen at any time. Markets have also entered a positive seasonal period with bullish historical statistics on their side. Dating back to 1950, the average year for the S&P 500 tends to see a seasonal (Fall) pullback bottom out on October 27th.In terms of tech strength, dating back to 1971 the Nasdaq has rallied in Q4 from its October low into year-end in 46 of 52 years (88.5%), with an average gain of 9.5%. Of the six losses, only one year (2007) was a pre-election year. Those are pretty favorable odds to say the least.If stocks are in for a fourth-quarter surge, where should we look?Key Stocks to WatchNot many stocks have held up well through the recent correction. Even fewer have hit new 52-week highs in October, but that’s exactly what we have in two well-known retail names.Both companies are part of the Zacks Retail – Apparel and Shoes industry group, which currently ranks in the top 33% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because this group is ranked in the top half of all industries, we expect it to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. Also note the favorable valuation metrics for this industry group below:ShutterstockImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHistorical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.American Eagle Outfitters AEO stock has begun to show signs of outperformance in the second half of the year. The company has benefitted from a boost in its Aerie and American Eagle brands, driven by solid demand and profit improvement initiatives. A Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, AEO has rallied more than 27% this year:StockChartsImage Source: StockChartsThe established retailer has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 43.15%. Analysts covering AEO have increased third-quarter earnings estimates by 17.95% in the past 60 days. The Q3 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $0.46/share, a 9.52% upgrade versus the same quarter last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnother leading stock in Abercrombie & Fitch ANF, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has exploded higher this year on continued momentum in the Abercrombie brand along with sequential improvement in the Hollister brand. ANF shares have surged nearly 157% this year:StockChartsImage Source: StockChartsThe modern-day fashion retailer has exceeded earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 725%. Analysts covering ANF are in agreement and have been raising earnings estimates across the board. For the third quarter, estimates have been raised by 10.31% in the past 60 days. The Q3 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $1.07/share, a whopping 10,600% improvement versus the same quarter last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat the Zacks Model RevealsThe Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) seeks to find companies that have recently witnessed positive earnings estimate revision activity. This more recent information can be a better predictor for future earnings and can give investors a leg up during earnings season. The technique has proven to be quite useful for finding positive earnings surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better with a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time according to our 10-year backtest.ANF is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and boasts a +1.87% Earnings ESP. Another beat may be in the cards when the company reports Q3 results on November 21st. ANF is ranked favorably by our Zacks Style Scores, with best-possible marks in our Value, Growth and Momentum categories.We’re now in the thick of the third-quarter earnings season. Remember, the stocks that hold up best through pullbacks and corrections typically lead the next leg up. Make sure you’re taking advantage of all that Zacks has to offer to uncover leading stocks like AEO and ANF.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.09 a share 21 days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 21, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.09 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.07 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Abercrombie & Fitch has an Earnings ESP of 1.87%.ANF is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is McDonald's (MCD).McDonald's is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on January 30, 2024. MCD's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.77 a share 91 days from its next earnings release.For McDonald's, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76 is 0.28%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, ANF and MCD could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Retail stocks will be under the microscope for the rest of the year.And there’s plenty of reason for enthusiasm. First, look at consumer sentiment. The U.S. economy grew a surprising 4.9% in the third quarter, more than twice as much as in the second quarter.Despite interest rate hikes, inflation and global turmoil, the economy is better than predicted, and we seem poised for a solid retail holiday season. Retail stocks are a good way to capitalize on those spending patterns and reap the rewards of higher sales and profits for retail companies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRetail stocks are also a pretty decent way to diversify a portfolio. You can look at different industries, such as home furnishings or electronics. You can choose between e-commerce and brick-and-mortar companies. You can even look at retail stocks in different parts of the world.No matter your interest, you’ll find all of these retail stocks with a Portfolio Grader rating. The Portfolio Grader ranks all stocks with a grade of “A” through “F” to help you decide the best names to buy.Here are seven to consider this holiday season.MercadoLibre (MELI)MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking to buy and sell in Latin America, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) may be the place for you. The company operates an e-commerce and digital marketplace responsible for more than 20% of all e-commerce sales in the region.But MercadoLibre doesn’t stop there. It also has a payment platform for people who want to make digital transfers but don’t want to use a bank. MercadoLibre also operates a shipping business and a loan division.The company’s “strong financial performance has been broad-based across geographies, with Brazil and Mexico making major contributions to the quarter’s profit growth and further diversifying our profit base,” management said in a letter to shareholders. “This gives us confidence as we continue to execute our growth plans across Latin America.”Story continuesSecond-quarter revenue was $3.4 billion, up 57.2% from a year ago. Income of $558 million more than doubled from last year.MELI will look to repeat that performance when it reports Q3 earnings in early November. For now, the stock is up 40% on the year, and it gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.PDD Holdings (PDD)A smartphone displays the Pinduoduo (PDD) website.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) is the parent company of Pinduoduo, a Chinese e-commerce company. Pinduoduo stands out because it combines e-commerce and social media. It encourages users to pool their orders with friends, family and others to buy bulk items at a discounted price.It also offers lower-priced products such as produce, household goods, cheap electronics and consumer items, making it a favorite among shoppers with a lower household income.And finally, Pinduoduo capitalizes on the social networking aspect by engaging users with games, drawings and incentivized check-ins that encourage daily interaction.Revenue in the second quarter was $7.2 billion up 66% from a year ago. The company also reported profits of $1.75 billion, an increase of 46%.PDD stock is up 31% this year. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF)The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.Source: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.comAbercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) is a U.S.-based retailer popular primarily with younger consumers. The company’s brands include Abercrombie, Hollister and Gilly Hicks, and it’s best known for its denim products, graphic T-shirts and outerwear.While some retailers struggled in the first half of the year with supply chain issues, inflation, sagging sales or lowered profit margins, Abercrombie is having a solid year. In the second quarter, the company recorded revenues of $935 million that was up 16% from a year ago.And because the company could keep inventories manageable, the operating income of $90 million was much better than the $2 million loss the company recorded in the same quarter a year ago.“While the macro environment remains dynamic, our first half results give us confidence to stay on offense for the second half,” CEO Fran Horowitz said. “Consistent with our ‘Always Forward’ plan, we are continuing to open stores and make critical long-term investments in digital and technology that will keep our brands in position to exceed our customers’ expectations.”That sets up ANF stock well for the third quarter and the holiday season. The company’s stock is up 160% this year, and it has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM)An exterior sign on a Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) store in Granada Hills, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAs I mentioned, retail stocks come in all shapes and flavors. Enter Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ:SFM), a U.S.-based grocery store chain that focuses on selling natural and organic products.The company has 400 stores in 23 U.S. states, opening six new stores in the second quarter. \xa0And the growth story continues, as Sprouts plans to open at least 10 new stores annually.“We believe we are on track with our long-term growth strategy, with positive traffic, an enhanced supply chain, and continued product innovation,” CEO Jack Sinclair said.The company is reporting Q3 earnings on Oct. 31. Shareholders hope it continues to perform well – the Q2 report showed sales of $1.7 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Comparable store sales growth grew by 3.2%.As more people are health conscious and looking for foods that fit that lifestyle, Sprouts is carving out a niche that should remain strong even if the economy begins to sour. But with good economic times, shoppers will line up for Sprouts’ premium offerings for their holiday tables.SFM stock is up 35% this year. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW)A Build-A-Bear (BBW) storefront in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comWhat says holidays more than a new stuffed toy? This is a big time of year for Build-A-Bear Workshop (NYSE:BBW).The specialty retailer is much more than a toy store. It’s an experience. Shoppers pick out an unstuffed toy and fill it with the stuffing themselves, then get to customize it with clothing and accessories.The company has more than 500 retail locations, and it’s building out its e-commerce site with an online bear builder and an animated workshop. The company has its “Bear Cave” online site for adult shoppers, which includes the After Dark section where you can buy bears with more suggestive clothing.Earnings for the second quarter were $109.2 million in revenue (up 8.5% from a year ago) and EPS of 57 cents per share (up 50% from a year ago). It reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance, increasing 5% to 7% yearly.BBW stock is up 2% this year, but I think it has a strong quarter in front of it. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.ThredUp (TDUP)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for ThredUp (TDUP).Source: II.studio / Shutterstock.comThredUp (NASDAQ:TDUP) operates an e-commerce platform for buying and selling pre-owned clothing for men, women and children.Rather than disposing of unwanted clothes or donating them, users can have a thrift store experience by using the ThredUp platform and work with buyers and sellers across the country.ThredUp says its platform has more than 35,000 brands, ensuring there’s something for virtually everyone. And the secondhand clothing market is significant, with expectations that it will grow from $211 billion this year to $351 billion by 2027.ThredUp, which became publicly traded only three years ago, has a small market cap of less than $300 million. In that light, its quarterly revenue in Q2 of $82.7 million was substantial. Revenue was up 8% from a year ago. The company posted a net loss of $18.8 million, an improvement on its loss of $28.4 million a year ago.As ThredUp scales and grows, the losses should turn into gains. TDUP stock is up 106% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Winmark (WINA)a person carrying several shopping bagsSource: ShutterstockWinmark (NASDAQ:WINA) is a Minnesota-based franchising business operating several second-hand retail franchise models. Its franchises include Plato’s Closet, Once Upon a Child, Play It Again Sports, Style Encore and Music Go Round.Customers can bring used clothing, sports equipment or musical instruments and sell them for cash or store credit. The company has more than 1,300 franchises and over 2,800 available territories.Third-quarter earnings showed revenue of $22.31 million, a gain of 5.4% from a year ago. Net income of $11.14 million was up 7.5% from last year. EPS was $3.05.Winmark announced that besides its quarterly dividend of 80 cents per share, the company is paying a special dividend of $9.40 per share to shareholders. That payout will push the company’s annual dividend yield to a respectable 3.1%.WINA stock shows solid gains throughout 2023, up 71%. It has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, neither Louis\xa0Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.More From InvestorPlaceMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

Santiago/Getty ImagesIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowANFWatchlistDozens of men have filed a class action lawsuit alleging Abercrombie & Fitch was complicit in a decade-long sex trafficking scheme carried out by the fashion company’s former CEO.According to the complaint filed Friday in federal court in New York, Michael Jeffries, who ran the company between 1992 and 2014, “used his role as CEO of Abercrombie to prey upon attractive young men who believed that Jeffries was going to hire them as an Abercrombie model.”Abercrombie & Fitch told CNN it does not comment on pending litigation.The complaint alleges Jeffries ran an expansive sex-trafficking operation, coercing and forcing young men to engage in sexual acts in exchange for money and promises of employment.The lawsuit states that, in a series of instances, one aspiring model was invited to multiple Abercrombie & Fitch casting events in New York, France and London, and was sexually assaulted at least seven times at these events. The model was allegedly led to believe that this process “was essential to become an Abercrombie model.”The total number of victims is believed to exceed 100, the lawsuit states, and “we anticipate more men coming forward in light of (the) filing,” said attorney Brittany Henderson, a partner of the firm representing some of the plaintiffs.“Sexual exploitation does not discriminate based on gender,” Henderson told CNN in a statement. “Men have been exploited in the modeling and fashion industries for decades. The #MeToo movement ignited a fire in our country that empowered survivors to come forward and be heard. This case is paramount to expanding the #MeToo movement across genders into the #WeToo movement, and eradicating sexual exploitation in the entire industry, starting with Abercrombie & Fitch.”The plaintiffs are seeking a trial by jury, as well as punitive and compensatory damages.“Mr. Jeffries will not comment in the press on this new lawsuit, as he has likewise chosen not to regarding litigation in the past. The courtroom is where we will deal with this matter,” Jeffries’ attorney Brian Bieber told CNN.Story continuesThe complaint also names Jeffries’ long-time partner Matthew Smith as a defendant claiming that he sexually assaulted men alongside Jeffries. While Smith did not hold any official position at the company, he was still given access to non-public information such as sales reports and financial documents, according to the complaint, and allowed to hold “managerial authority.”Bieber said that Smith does not yet have legal representation. CNN has not been able to determine whether he has retained a lawyer.The 21-count lawsuit brings nine counts against Abercrombie & Fitch, alleging that the company was aware of Jeffries’ and Smith’s abuse and knowingly turned a blind eye to the “unfettered” amount of money that Jefferies withdrew from corporate-affiliated accounts in order to pay off victims.“To put it plainly, Jeffries needed a corporation that knew he was engaging in illegal activity and did not care, which Jeffries had in Abercrombie,” the complaint states, adding that this negligence makes Abercrombie & Fitch liable for the physical injury and emotional distress experienced by the plaintiffs as a result of the alleged assault committed by Jeffries and Smith.“Abercrombie financially benefited in that as a by-product of the sex-trafficking venture, (the company) was able to employ male models to further promote their brand image, while simultaneously keeping Jeffries happy and productive, allowing him to rebrand the company’s image and transform it into a billion-dollar industry leader,” the lawsuit states.The lawsuit comes less than a month after the BBC published allegations of eight men who said Jeffries and his partner Smith exploited them for sex. The men alleged they were recruited through a middleman who used a network of recruiters, and paid them $500 to $1,000 for every referral, according to the BBC report, which was the culmination of a two-year investigation.Days after the BBC report, Abercrombie & Fitch said it had launched its own investigation into the allegations.“The company’s current executive leadership team and board of directors were not aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Jeffries,” the retailer told CNN in a statement earlier this month. “For close to a decade, a new executive leadership team and refreshed board of directors have successfully transformed our brands and culture into the values-driven organization we are today. We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind.”CNN’s Parija Kavilanz contributed to this reportFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com', 'ANFANNE D\'INNOCENZIOOctober 27, 2023 at 11:27 AM·2 min readFILE - In this May 22, 2017, file photo, a store window reflects a street scene at an Abercrombie & Fitch store on New York\'s Fifth Avenue.

But he faced criticism for the company\'s sexualized marketing, including billboards and beefy models that alienated potential customers who didn\'t fit into its image.The lawsuit comes after a BBC report earlier this month that raised similar allegations against Jeffries and his partner Matthew Smith.The lawsuit, filed by David Bradberry in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges Jeffries had modeling scouts scouring the internet and elsewhere to identify attractive young men seeking to be the next face of Abercrombie. Often these prospective models became sex-trafficking victims, sent to New York and abroad and abused by Jeffries and other men, all under the guise that they were being recruited to become the next Abercrombie model, the lawsuit contends.“Jeffries was so important to the profitability of the brand that he was given complete autonomy to perform his role as CEO however he saw fit, including through the use of blatant international sex-trafficking and abuse of prospective Abercrombie models,” the suit alleges.The lawsuit names Jeffries, Smith, and the Jeffries Family Office LLC. It seeks class-action status and estimates that over a hundred young models, in addition to Bradberry, were victims.A&F, based in New Albany, Ohio, declined to comment Friday. Earlier this month, the retailer said that it had hired an outside law firm to conduct an independent investigation into the issues raised by the BBC. It said the company’s current leaders and board of directors were not aware of the allegations of Jeffries\' sexual misconduct.Story continues“For close to a decade, a new executive leadership team and refreshed board of directors have successfully transformed our brands and culture into the values-driven organization we are today,"" the company said. “We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind.”Jeffries\' attorney, Brian Bieber, a shareholder with the Miami law firm of GrayRobinson, said in a statement that Jeffries “will not comment in the press on this new lawsuit, as he has likewise chosen not to regarding litigation in the past. ”“The courtroom is where we will deal with this matter,"" Bieber added.The Jeffries Family Office didn\'t respond immediately for requests for comment.______Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio']"

US-based companies are also spearheading technological advancements across various industries, therefore fueling the demand for consultancy agencies that are experts in the technology sector.\xa0 Moreover, Canadian companies are also increasingly adopting digitization, thus creating a reliance on consulting firms to guide them in the right direction for maximum profit.

Data and AI are the highest priority tech investments, with 79% of CHROs planning to invest in these areas next year, a 10% jump from this year.HR leaders are generally optimistic about AI. The majority of respondents say the technology will enhance productivity by automating routine tasks, enable increased focus on creative and innovative tasks, and improve job satisfaction by, again, reducing time spent on mundane tasks. About half say it will allow employees to engage in more meaningful work.All surveyed CHROs report already implementing some form of generative AI training in their organization. Seventy-four percent say they provide training on effectively using generative AI, and 56% plan to offer academic partnerships that provide AI skills training next year.Accenture is one of them. The professional services firm recently announced\xa0a three-year,\xa0$3 billion investment in AI that will double its AI talent to 80,000. For Allison Horn, Accenture’s global head of talent, the company's survey results provide a sigh of relief that her peers are also investing in the novel technology.“It's reassuring. This is game-changing in a really good, positive, energy-producing way,” she says. “Generative AI is really going to get rid of some of the mundane work and get us to the parts of work that we all enjoy more.”Interestingly, though, the top AI investment priority for HR leaders isn't in their function. Rather, it's in customer service (56%), followed by HR (45%), and finance (44%). That differs from CEOs' AI investment priorities. Of the 429 CEOs polled, the top use cases for generative AI are in the supply chain, manufacturing, and customer service, while HR is the lowest priority.Story continuesIt may surprise some that HR isn’t a top focus for chief executives or even their people ops leaders, but both functions agree that customer service is an area that will see quicker ROI in improving job quality.“When you see something like what generative AI can produce for things like customer service and call centers, it's an obvious value case,” says Horn. “And it's also one that usually has scale...If you're talking about something like call centers, [that’s] hundreds or thousands of people. So you can start to see this value very quickly.”Paige McGlauflinpaige.mcglauflin@fortune.com@paidionThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com""]"
ADBE,"[""ADBEeditorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)November 3, 2023 at 7:00 AM·3 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowADBEWatchlistOver the past year, many Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Adobe Adobe Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman & CEO, Shantanu Narayen, for US$17m worth of shares, at about US$481 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$559, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 8.0% of Shantanu Narayen's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in Adobe than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Adobe insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$415m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Adobe Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Adobe shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Adobe insiders selling. Of course, the future is what matters most.

Adobe picks up licensing fees from customers, which form the bulk of its revenue.ADBE was added to the Zacks Focus List on March 13, 2020 at $285 per share. Since then, shares have increased 96.04% to $558.71.14 analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2023, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.58 to $15.93. ADBE also boasts an average earnings surprise of 3.3%.Additionally, Adobe Systems' earnings are expected to grow 16.2% for the current fiscal year.Since stock prices respond to earnings estimate revisions, it can be very profitable to buy stocks with an increased earnings outlook.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +8.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Adobe falls in, has gained 6.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Adobe is expected to post earnings of $4.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $15.93 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +16.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.86 indicates a change of +12.1% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Adobe is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Adobe, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.01 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.37 billion and $21.61 billion estimates indicate +10% and +11.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAdobe reported revenues of $4.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.3%. EPS of $4.09 for the same period compares with $3.40 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.85 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.72%. The EPS surprise was +3.02%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Adobe is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Adobe. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see some more stocks on the list, go directly to 5 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts.US stocks recovered on Monday after suffering losses amid geopolitical headwinds and concerns around rising inflation and rate hikes. Other market movements included a drop in Brent crude oil prices and a slip in gold prices. These shifts indicated a reduced demand for safe-haven assets as risk appetite among investors increased. Meanwhile, the ten-year Treasury yields saw a modest increase, reaching 4.85%. Treasury market is bracing for an upcoming SEC rule, aiming to regulate hedge fund bets and enhance financial stability. The rule, proposed last September, could shift more trading in the $25 trillion Treasuries market to central clearing, impacting industry dynamics. Market participants anticipate the rule's finalization within weeks, potentially by mid-November, but key details remain uncertain, reported Reuters. Concerns include the implementation timeline and whether the industry will transition to central clearing all at once or in phases. The rule's impact on industry players, including banks and hedge funds, is unclear, raising questions about costs and potential disruptions. Experts emphasize the need for careful implementation to avoid unintended consequences. The SEC rule is a significant response to the review launched after the near market collapse in March 2020. Treasury market reform is widely supported, but the specifics of the SEC rule's impact remain uncertain. The industry expects the final rule next month, prompting preparations for potential changes.The financial landscape in the Asia-Pacific region is poised for a distinctive trajectory as central banks in the area are anticipated to embark on a series of interest rate hikes over the next six months. This stands in contrast to prevailing trends in other regions where either a status quo in interest rates is expected or substantial cuts are anticipated. The driving forces behind this regional divergence include the resilience of the U.S. dollar and the upward trajectory of oil prices. Countries spanning from Australia to Indonesia and South Korea are set to uphold a tightening monetary policy stance. Traders are expressing this sentiment through an average estimation of a 13 basis points increase in interest rates for the Asia-Pacific region, excluding China. This projection is derived from market implied policy rates, underlining the expectations for a gradual tightening of monetary conditions. In contrast, developed markets outside of Asia are expected to maintain their existing interest rate levels. However, in regions such as Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, substantial cuts in interest rates are anticipated.Story continuesMeanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., tech stocks such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Snap Inc.

Last year saw steep losses, this year started with a strong rally, and the last few months have seen a correction. The big question now is whether the recent market turbulence is a temporary blip or the beginning of a more significant downturn.John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist from Oppenheimer, has set out the bullish case, as befits a man who’s predicting the S&P 500 will hit 4,900 by year’s end – or a gain of 18% in just the next two months.In part, Stoltzfus sees the Federal Reserve’s current policy of monetary tightening as a key supportive factor for the economy and the markets. In recent comments with CNBC, the Oppenheimer strategist said, “We were expecting that the Fed would continue to be vigilant against inflation but would remain sensitive to effects of its policy on the economy. We said it would depend on the resilience of the economy, and today’s GDP print says ‘resilience’ all over it, and the current third quarter earnings season is showing resilience…”Stoltzfus isn’t the only bull at Oppenheimer; the firm’s stock analysts are picking out the stocks that can lead the way forward. We’ve used the database at TipRanks to pull up the details on 2 of these stock picks; here they are, presented along with comments from some of Oppenheimer’s top stock analysts.Don’t missJ.P. Morgan Is Looking for the Silver Lining in the Current Market Headwinds — Here Are 2 Stocks the Banking Giant Likes Right NowTipRanks’ ‘Perfect 10’ List:\xa0These 2 Top-Rated Industrial Stocks Have What It Takes to SurgeBank of America Says Contrarian Buy Signal Could Push Stocks Higher;\xa0Here Are 2 Names the Banking Giant Likes Right NowAdobe, Inc. (ADBE)We’ll start with Adobe, the software company that leads the field in publishing and content creation tools, as well as design and editing tools. Adobe is well-known as the distributor of the Creative Cloud, the content creation package that includes Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, among others, serving as a one-stop shop for digital creation professionals.Story continuesThe company has a global footprint and more than 29,000 employees – and it brought in more than $17.6 billion in total revenue last year. The company has solid prospects going forward as it embraces emerging AI technology to enhance its product lines. Adobe’s Firefly product, a generative AI system capable of adding features across Adobe’s full product line, is designed to streamline the content creation process in all forms. From the product user’s perspective, Adobe’s addition of AI into its software offers the promise of significant improvements in efficiency and production times.In short, Adobe effectively meets the challenges of today’s digital world, as reflected in the company’s financial results. Adobe has witnessed both revenues and earnings on an upward trajectory for the past several years, and the recently reported Q3 of fiscal year 2023 continues this trend.The company’s top-line performance in the quarter, which concluded this past September 1, reached $4.89 billion, a 10% year-over-year increase and $20 million better than expected. At the bottom line, the non-GAAP EPS amounted to $4.09, surpassing estimates by 11 cents. Year-over-year EPS growth exceeded 20%, and the company generated $1.87 billion in cash from operations.Oppenheimer’s 5-star analyst, Brian Schwartz, is impressed by Adobe’s forward prospects, and writes, “We see a strengthening business momentum, a favorable outlook for FY2024, and durable growth based on positive fundamental trends and a top position in software for the generative AI opportunity gleaned from our customer and industry surveys…”The analyst, who is ranked in the top 1% off all Wall Street analysts, goes on to add, “In our view, Adobe investors will be rewarded through year-end and next fiscal year as concerns on penetration, pricing tolerance, and generative AI weakening the competitive moat dissipates. Additionally, investors will increasingly appreciate that its internal R&D and Firefly product strategy has successfully reenergized its product portfolio and places the company in a better position for durable growth from adding users and monetizing on its large install-base.”Schwartz uses these comments to back up his rating on the stock, which he upgrades from Neutral to Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his price target of $660 implies a one-year upside potential of 26%. (Watch Schwartz’s track record)Leading tech firms usually get plenty of Wall Street attention, and Adobe has 28 recent analyst reviews on file. These break down to 20 Buys, 7 Holds, and 1 Sell – for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. ADBE shares are priced at $522.84 and the average target price, $609.85, suggests a gain of ~17% lies on the horizon. (See ADBE stock forecast)Xylem, Inc. (XYL)For our second Oppenheimer pick, we’re staying within the technology sector, but this time, we’re focusing on water technology. Xylem is a leading provider of high-end water transport and treatment technology. The company claims a diverse customer base that includes residential, commercial, and agricultural water suppliers, as well as industrial firms and public utilities. Xylem has business around the world, in 150 countries, and boasts a $21 billion market cap.In May of this year, the company announced a merger with Evoqua Water Technologies, a move that created the most advanced platform for meeting water challenges in the world today. The merger was an all-stock transaction valued at $7.5 billion. The combined company continues under the Xylem name, and its product line includes pumps, valves, heat exchangers, dispensing equipment, and treatment and testing equipment, designed in-house and distributed worldwide to meet modern challenges of water scarcity, which affect at least 1.8 billion people.The last set of quarterly results, released in August for 2Q23, included results after the Evoqua merger. The company’s top line for Q2 came to $1.7 billion, up 26% y/y and some $60 million ahead of expectations. The firm’s bottom line, reported as a non-GAAP EPS of 98 cents for the six months ended on June 30, was 17 cents better than had been forecast. Xylem finished Q2 with $708 million in cash and liquid assets on hand, down from $944 million at the end of 2022. The company’s total assets were up, however, from $7.9 billion on December 31 to $16.1 billion on June 30; this reflected gains from the Evoqua acquisition.Along with the Q2 results, Xylem raised its full-year revenue guidance for 2023 by 30% to $7.2 billion. This compared favorably to the consensus estimate of $7.14 billion.This stock caught the attention of Bryan Blair, another of Oppenheimer’s 5-star analysts. Blair is upbeat on Xylem’s post-merger expansion and prospects, and writes, “We rate XYL shares Outperform given confidence in New Xylem’s structurally improved portfolio, continued beat & raise prospects, compelling medium term growth upside, and increasingly supportive valuation following YTD share pressure. Near-term dilution appears inevitable (albeit firmly baked into expectations) and deal execution is an understandable concern given the scale of Xylem’s richly-valued Evoqua acquisition. That said, we view other trading headwinds as largely transitory (in turn driving the current buying opportunity) and strongly believe that combined Xylem–Evoqua operations are positioned for transformational and increasingly profitable growth over the coming years.”Blair’s Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating is complemented by his $118 price target, which points toward a 33% upside on the one -year horizon. (Watch Blair’s track record)Once again, we’re looking at a stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street, this one based on 9 reviews that include 6 Buys and 3 Holds. The stock’s $88.96 selling price and $123.38 average price target together imply a potential 12-month upside of ~39%.

If you want to skip our introduction to the stock market and the different kinds of stocks that can be traded, then read 5 Best Large Cap Stocks To Buy Now. Stocks can be divided and segregated by several different criteria. One approach is to sort them through industries, which allows one to tailor an investment approach to the broader economic climate as well as regulatory and governmental incentives that might prove to be catalysts for sectors such as electric vehicles.Another common approach in classifying stocks is using their market capitalization. The market capitalization of a company is its value calculated after multiplying its total shares outstanding with its current share price. It provides an easy way to gauge the value of a company in the eyes of investors as well as its financial heft demonstrated by the balance sheet. Within the stock market, stocks are classified as micro cap stocks, small cap stocks, large cap stocks, and mega cap stocks. Large cap stocks belong to companies whose market capitalization ranges between $10 billion and $200 billion, and the large cap classification is the final rung on the latter that a firm has to climb before it can be classified as a lucrative mega cap stock.While few analysts would advise anyone to invest in a stock based truly on its market capitalization, each category of these classifications has its own benefits and drawbacks. For large cap stocks, the potential to make a high percentage return is greater than a mega cap stock, and at the same time, the relative stability of these companies and their higher share prices when compared to small caps also provide a buffer against losses due to adverse business or economic conditions as well as market manipulation and scams.Data compiled by Stock Analysis shows that as of early November 2023, there are 704 large cap stocks trading on U.S. exchanges. Cumulatively, these have a market capitalization of $29 trillion and total revenue of $16.36 trillion. Compare this to the statistics for small cap stocks and you might be stunned by the difference. This is because the next lower rung on our stock classification ladder, small cap stocks, has a market capitalization of $1.2 trillion and combined revenue of $1.6 trillion. In short, large cap companies have ten times the revenue of small cap companies, and more than twenty times the market capitalization. But what about mega cap stocks? Well, this list of firms made up of big ticket technology names such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have a combined market capitalization of $21.16 trillion and total revenue of $5.9 trillion.Story continuesLooking at this data, it's clear that when lumped together, the large cap segment is the most lucrative on the stock market in terms of both revenue and market capitalization. This is unsurprising really since when compared to the 704 large cap stocks being traded on U.S. stock markets, a rather handful of 37 stocks are classified as mega cap stocks. This lends an average mega cap company $159 billion in revenue while the figure for an average large cap stock is $23.23 billion.So, what are these large cap companies, and which of these dominate the market capitalization pie? Well, one of the most valuable large cap companies in the world, and one whose market capitalization is on the cusp of making it a mega cap stock is the British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN). It has $198 billion in market capitalization, and an average share price rating of Strong Buy according to data compiled by Yahoo Finance. Analysts have also priced in a 31% share price upside to the stock. In terms of its products, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) has had an active latter half of 2023. One of its biggest announcements came in late October 2023 when it announced that its lung cancer drug performed better than a standard treatment in a Phase 3 trial. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is also slated to release its earnings report soon, and analysts have set an EPS forecast of 79 cents for the firm.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best large cap stocks to buy, and some notable names are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Merck & Co., Inc. MRK, Bank of America Corp. BAC, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Union Pacific Corp. UNP.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard and Analyst Reports for Merck, BofA and AMDThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the ongoing Q3 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck & Co., Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here >>>Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the results that came out the morning of Thursday, November 2nd, we now have Q3 results from 377 S&P 500 members or 75.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +1.1% from the same period last year on +1.6% higher revenues, with 82% beating EPS estimates and 61.8% beating revenue estimates.This is better earnings growth for these 377 index members relative to what we have seen from this group in the last four quarters. The EPS beats percentage at 82% is the highest for this group of 377 index members since 2021 Q2 and above the average for the preceding 20 quarters of 77.4%.The picture is different on the revenues side, with the Q3 revenue growth rate of +1.6% above the preceding period's +0.9%. but otherwise representing a decelerating growth trend.A much smaller proportion of companies have been able to beat consensus revenue estimates. In fact, the 61.8% revenue beats percentage for Q3 for these 377 index member is the lowest for this group of companies since 2020 Q1 when Covid got underway. The Q3 revenue beats percentage remains above the 20-quarter low of 58.9% but otherwise remains well below the 20-quarter average of 69.9%.Story continuesLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining the actuals for the 377 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-companies, total earnings are expected to increase +2% from the same period last year on +1.5% higher revenues.This is the first time quarterly earnings growth has turned positive after three back-to-back quarters of declines.Today's Featured Analyst Reports Merck shares have gained +7.0% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's gain of +15.2%. Company's products like Keytruda and Gardasil have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth. Merck is investing in M&A activity to strengthen its pipeline.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck's ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda's loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)Shares of Bank of America have underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (-3.7% vs. +0.8%). Because of inflationary pressure, overall costs are expected to remain elevated. The current tough macroeconomic outlook might weigh on the company's investment banking (IB) business.This, along with the volatile nature of the capital markets, might hurt non-interest income growth. Despite these headwinds, we believe that higher rates and decent loan demand will keep aiding the company's net interest income (NII) growth. The opening of financial centers and improving digital capabilities is expected to further aid the top line.(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)AMD shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the year-to-date period (+66.8% vs. +40.1%). The company's strong adoption of Ryzen and fourth-generation EPYC CPU drove Data Center and Client revenues sequentially in the third quarter. AMD expects to witness year-over-year growth in the Data Center and Client segments by double-digit percentage for the current quarter.Sequentially, Data Center segment revenues are expected to grow by a double-digit percentage. However, AMD's third-quarter 2023 results suffered from weak Gaming and Embedded revenues. Gaming declined due to lower semi-custom revenues while Embedded segment suffered from lower performance in the communications market.AMD expects weakness in the Gaming and Embedded segment to hurt revenues in the current quarter. Gaming and Embedded segment revenues are expected to decline by a double-digit percentage on a sequential basis.(You can read the full research report on AMD here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Netflix, Inc. and Union Pacific Corp.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Below are 5 reasons the worst is over for semiconductors:Historical Seasonality TrendsEquity investors often utilize historical seasonality trends as a valuable tool to gain an edge in the market. By analyzing past price movements and patterns specific to certain times of the year, investors can identify recurring trends in stock and industry performance. It\'s difficult to find a more robust and reliable historical seasonality trend than the semiconductor stocks. The PHLX Semiconductor Index was higher 80% of the time over the past twenty years for an average gain of 3.9%. Select individual names do even better in November. For example, Advanced Micro Devices has been higher 8 of the past 10 Novembers for an average gain of 15.9%. Meanwhile, industry group peer Nvidia has racked up gains of 9.1% on average over the same time.Strong Earnings Thus far this earnings season, semiconductor earnings are mixed. For example, ON Semiconductor plunged more than 20% after reporting disappointing earnings. That said, industry leaders such as AMD and Intel have produced impressive results.AI Investment Is ProliferatingEarlier this week,Arista Networks, a leading provider of cloud networking solutions, reported blockbuster earnings growth of 46% year-over-year. Arista\'s earnings prove that the AI revolution is still in the early innings because as artificial intelligence technologies continue to advance, the demand for high-performance, low-latency networking infrastructure rises. Semiconductors are another group of stocks that directly benefit from growth in AI.Story continuesEnd of Year Institutional ""Window Dressing""On Wall Street, the term window dressing refers to the practice where institutional money managers make their portfolios appear more attractive or healthier than they actually are to clients, especially before reporting periods like quarterly and annual statements are due. To dress up their portfolios, many managers will sell laggards and buy into high-performing ones just before the reporting date.By showcasing these stronger assets in their reports, fund managers aim to impress clients by creating a false impression of the fund\'s performance. In other words, the manager shows that the fund did not miss out on the year\'s big winners. With the Semiconductor Index ETF up ~40% year-to-date (and many individual names like NVDA up more), institutional investors are likely to pile into semiconductors into year-end for window dressing purposes.Bullish Technicals Though many investors have become bearish on semiconductors after the latest correction, the longer-term chart patterns show signs of life. For example, industry leader AMD is finding support at its rising 200-day moving average and is poised to break a downtrend line going back to June.Why Haven\'t You Looked at Zacks\' Top Stocks?

Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the ongoing Q3 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK), Bank of America Corporation (BAC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the results that came out the morning of Thursday, November 2nd, we now have Q3 results from 377 S&P 500 members or 75.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +1.1% from the same period last year on +1.6% higher revenues, with 82% beating EPS estimates and 61.8% beating revenue estimates. This is better earnings growth for these 377 index members relative to what we have seen from this group in the last four quarters. The EPS beats percentage at 82% is the highest for this group of 377 index members since 2021 Q2 and above the average for the preceding 20 quarters of 77.4%. The picture is different on the revenues side, with the Q3 revenue growth rate of +1.6% above the preceding period's +0.9%. but otherwise representing a decelerating growth trend. A much smaller proportion of companies have been able to beat consensus revenue estimates. In fact, the 61.8% revenue beats percentage for Q3 for these 377 index member is the lowest for this group of companies since 2020 Q1 when Covid got underway. The Q3 revenue beats percentage remains above the 20-quarter low of 58.9% but otherwise remains well below the 20-quarter average of 69.9%. Looking at Q3 as a whole, combining the actuals for the 377 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-companies, total earnings are expected to increase +2% from the same period last year on +1.5% higher revenues. Story continuesThis is the first time quarterly earnings growth has turned positive after three back-to-back quarters of declines.Today's Featured Analyst Reports\xa0 Merck share have gained +7.0% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +15.2%. Company’s products like Keytruda and Gardasil have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth. Merck is investing in M&A activity to strengthen its pipeline.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)Shares of Bank of America have underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (-3.7% vs. +0.8%). Because of inflationary pressure, overall costs are expected to remain elevated. The current tough macroeconomic outlook might weigh on the company’s investment banking (IB) business.This, along with the volatile nature of the capital markets, might hurt non-interest income growth. Despite these headwinds, we believe that higher rates and decent loan demand will keep aiding the company’s net interest income (NII) growth. The opening of financial centers and improving digital capabilities is expected to further aid the top line.(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)AMD shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the year-to-date period (+66.8% vs. +40.1%). The company’s strong adoption of Ryzen and fourth-generation EPYC CPU drove Data Center and Client revenues sequentially in third quarter. AMD expects to witness year-over-year growth in the Data Center and Client segments by double-digit percentage for the current quarter.Sequentially, Data Center segment revenues are expected to grow on a double-digit percentage. However, AMD’s third-quarter 2023 results suffered from weak Gaming and Embedded revenues. Gaming declined due to lower semi-custom revenues while Embedded segment suffered from lower performance in the communications market.AMD expects weakness in the Gaming and Embedded segment to hurt revenues in the current quarter. Gaming and Embedded segment revenues are expected to decline by a double-digit percentage on a sequential basis.(You can read the full research report on AMD here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Netflix, Inc.

However, stiff competition and leveraged balance sheet remain concerns.EQT Corp (EQT) to Gain From Rising Demand for Clean EnergyPer the Zacks analyst, EQT Corp is poised to capitalize on the rising clean energy demand due to its top position as a natural gas producer in the Appalachian Basin.

A copy of the same can be\xa0downloaded here. In the third quarter, the strategy returned -4.6% net of fees bringing YTD returns to -8.73% net. The long book declined by 6.92% while the short book rose by 2.7%. Losses in the long book were driven by a significant decrease in the price of the fund’s exposure to the Industrial, Materials, and Utilities sectors. The Energy sector was the only bright spot in the quarter, along with the short book. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the strategy to know its best picks in 2023.Massif Capital highlighted stocks like The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in the third quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a diversified power generation and utility company. On November 2, 2023, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) stock closed at $15.50 per share. One-month return of The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) was 22.92%, and its shares lost 40.82% of their value over the last 52 weeks. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) has a market capitalization of $10.379 billion.Massif Capital made the following comment about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:""Given interest rates’ elevated state, it is perhaps unsurprising that our utility exposure has fared poorly for us this year. We should have hedged the exposure sooner with a Utility ETF short, but we did not do that until the third quarter, after much of the damage was already done. As noted above, our Utility exposure is second only to our materials exposure in terms of negative impact on the portfolio across both the third quarter and the YTD periods. This is primarily driven by our investment in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), which was down roughly 26% in the third quarter and 47% YTD. Our other utility exposure is up for the year, including our short position, which, as noted, was put on in the third quarter, and it is probably something we should have had on the books for the entire year.We attribute, for right or wrong, the entirety of the sell-off in AES to the interest rate environment. Chart overlays are always tricky, so one should not read too much into them, but as a quick sense check of the claim, if one inverts the move-in rates for a generic 10-year US government bond and overlay it with AES stock price YTD, you get the following:..""

(PRNewsfoto/The AES Corporation)""We had a strong third quarter across the board and are on track to deliver on all of our financial and strategic objectives,"" said Andrés Gluski, AES President and Chief Executive Officer.\xa0 ""We fully expect to complete construction of 3.5 GW of new renewables this year, which is more than double compared to last year.\xa0 Demand for renewables with long-term contracts remains exceptionally strong across the sector, and particularly from our primary customers, large technology companies and data centers.\xa0 As a result of this demand, we have signed a total of 3.7 GW of contracts for new renewables so far this year and expect to sign at least 5 GW before the end of the year.""Story continues""We expect to be in the top half of our Adjusted EPS4\xa0guidance range for 2023 and we are reaffirming all of our short- and long-term financial guidance metrics.\xa0 Our hedging programs and low-risk commercial structure ensure that we continue to have limited exposure to interest rates,"" said Stephen Coughlin, AES Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\xa0 ""We have already secured our asset sale proceeds target and external financing needs for the year, further strengthening our balance sheet.\xa0 Additionally, we are accelerating and increasing our asset sale program to eliminate any need for new equity until at least 2026.""Q3 2023 Financial ResultsThird quarter 2023 Net Income was $291 million, a decrease of $155 million compared to third quarter 2022.\xa0 This decrease is the result of lower contributions from LNG transactions versus 2022 at the Energy Infrastructure Strategic Business Unit (SBU), partially offset by favorable contributions at the Utilities, Renewables, and New Energy Technologies SBUs.Third quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA5\xa0(a non-GAAP financial measure) was $990 million, an increase of $59 million compared to third quarter 2022, primarily driven by higher contributions at the Utilities SBU, favorable weather conditions and new businesses at the Renewables SBU, higher revenues under a PPA termination agreement at the Energy Infrastructure SBU, and improved margins at Fluence at the New Energy Technologies SBU.\xa0 These positive drivers were partially offset by favorable LNG transactions in 2022 at the Energy Infrastructure SBU.During the third quarter of 2023, the Company realized Tax Attributes6\xa0of $18 million, a decrease of $42 million compared to third quarter 2022.Third quarter 2023 Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations (Diluted EPS) was $0.32, a decrease of $0.27 compared to third quarter 2022, primarily reflecting higher long-lived asset impairments in 2023 and lower earnings at the Energy Infrastructure SBU mainly due to unrealized foreign currency losses and favorable LNG transactions in 2022.\xa0 These negative drivers were partially offset by higher contributions at the Utilities SBU due to the 2022 recognition of previously deferred fuel and energy purchases and favorable weather conditions and new businesses at the Renewables SBU.Third quarter 2023 Adjusted Earnings Per Share7 (Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure) was $0.60, a decrease of $0.03, compared to third quarter 2022, mainly driven by lower contributions from the Energy Infrastructure SBU, higher Parent interest, and a higher adjusted tax rate, partially offset by higher contributions at the Utilities SBU.Strategic AccomplishmentsAs of today, the Company\'s backlog, which consists of projects with signed contracts, but which are not yet operational, is 13,138 MW, including 5,761 MW under construction.In year-to-date 2023, the Company completed the construction or acquisition of 1,314 MW of wind, solar and energy storage and expects to complete a total of 3.5 GW by year-end 2023.In year-to-date 2023, the Company has signed 3,740 MW of contracts for new renewables.In September 2023, the Company agreed to minority sell-downs of its businesses in the Dominican Republic and Panama, for a total of $190 million in asset sale proceeds.Guidance and Expectations7,8The Company is reaffirming its 2023 guidance for Adjusted EBITDA8 of $2,600 to $2,900 million, and its expectation for annualized growth in Adjusted EBITDA8 of 3% to 5% through 2027, from a base of its reaffirmed 2023 guidance.\xa0 Excluding the Company\'s Energy Infrastructure SBU, annualized growth in Adjusted EBITDA8 is expected to be 17% to 20% through 2027, from a base of 2023 guidance.The Company now expects full year 2023\xa0 Adjusted EPS7 to be in the top half of the guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75.\xa0 Growth in 2023 is expected to be primarily driven by new renewables expected to come online.\xa0 This growth is expected to be partially offset by lower margins from the Company\'s LNG business, due to normalization of LNG prices and the roll-off of a gas supply contract, lower contract margins in Chile, and higher interest expense in Colombia.The Company is reaffirming its annualized growth target for Adjusted EPS7 of 7% to 9% through 2025, from a base year of 2020.\xa0 The Company is also reaffirming its annualized growth target for Adjusted EPS7 of 6% to 8% through 2027, from a base of its reaffirmed 2023 guidance of $1.65 to $1.75.The Company\'s 2023 guidance is based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of September 30, 2023.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresSee Non-GAAP Measures for definitions of Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Pre-Tax Contribution, and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as

CORPORATIONNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(Unaudited)RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED PTC AND ADJUSTED EPSEBITDA is defined as earnings before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of NCI and interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of our equity affiliates, adding back interest income recognized under service concession arrangements, and excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the Energy Infrastructure SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, adding back the pre-tax effect of Production Tax Credits (""PTCs""), Investment Tax Credits (""ITCs""), and depreciation tax expense allocated to tax equity investors.The GAAP measure most comparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes is net income. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is the most relevant measure considered in the Company\'s internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments.\xa0Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, and the variability of allocations of earnings to tax equity investors, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, each of these metrics represent the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes should not be construed as alternatives to net income, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\xa0Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA (in millions)2023202220232022Net income (loss)$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 291$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 446$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 461$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 481Income tax expense (benefit)109145179186Interest expense326276966813Interest income(144)(100)(398)(270)Depreciation and amortization286266836800EBITDA$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 868$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 1,033$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,044$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,010Less: Adjustment for noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries (1)(183)(174)(508)(486)Less: Income tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income) and depreciation and amortization from equity affiliates27369393Interest income recognized under service concession arrangements18195458Unrealized derivative and equity securities losses (gains)10(8)3—Unrealized foreign currency losses97316123Disposition/acquisition losses842136Impairment losses14517318497Loss on extinguishment of debt—117Adjusted EBITDA$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 990$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 931$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,187$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,238Tax attributes allocated to tax equity investors186069109Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes (2)$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 1,008$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 991$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,256$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 2,347_____________________________(1)The allocation of earnings to tax equity investors from both consolidated entities and equity affiliates is removed from Adjusted EBITDA.(2)Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes includes the impact of the share of the ITCs, PTCs, and depreciation expense allocated to tax equity investors under the HLBV accounting method and recognized as Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.

1,165_______________________________(1)Subsidiary distributions received by Qualified Holding Companies (""QHCs"") excluded from Schedule 1. Subsidiary Distributions should not be construed as an alternative to Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, which is determined in accordance with USGAAP.\xa0Subsidiary Distributions are important to the Parent Company because the Parent Company is a holding company that does not derive any significant direct revenues from its own activities but instead relies on its subsidiaries\' business activities and the resultant distributions tofund the debt service, investment and other cash needs of the holding company.\xa0The reconciliation of the difference between the SubsidiaryDistributions and Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities consists of cash generated from operating activities that is retained atthe subsidiaries for a variety of reasons which are both discretionary and non-discretionary in nature.\xa0These factors include, but are not limitedto, retention of cash to fund capital expenditures at the subsidiary, cash retention associated with non-recourse debt covenant restrictions andrelated debt service requirements at the subsidiaries, retention of cash related to sufficiency of local GAAP statutory retained earnings at the subsidiaries, retention of cash for working capital needs at the subsidiaries, and other similar timing differences between when the cash is generated at the subsidiaries and when it reaches the Parent Company and related holding companies.(2)Parent Company Liquidity is defined as cash available to the Parent Company, including cash at qualified holding companies (QHCs), plusavailable borrowings under our existing credit facility. AES believes that unconsolidated Parent Company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent Company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES\' indebtedness.(3)The cash held at QHCs represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US. Such subsidiaries have no contractualrestrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the Parent Company. Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and generalcosts and expenses incurred outside the US. Since the cash held by these QHCs is available to the Parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to Parent and QHCs as a useful measure of cash available to the Parent to meet its international liquidity needs.\xa0Investor Contact: Susan Harcourt 703-682-1204, susan.harcourt@aes.comMedia Contact: Amy Ackerman 703-682-6399, amy.ackerman@aes.comCisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aes-expects-full-year-2023-adjusted-eps-to-be-in-the-top-half-of-guidance-range-of-1-65-to-1-75--301976483.htmlSOURCE AES CORP.', 'AESAESCEDZacks Equity ResearchOctober 31, 2023 at 5:03 AM·3 min readIn this article: Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowOops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowOops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.More content belowAESWatchlistAESCEDThe AES Corporation AES is slated to report third-quarter 2023 results on Nov 3, before market open.It reported a negative earnings surprise of 16% in the last reported quarter. The company delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 0.29% for the last four quarters.Factors to NoteIn the third quarter, AES’ service territories witnessed a mostly average weather pattern, which, in turn, is likely to have had a moderate impact on the company’s top-line performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The AES Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe AES Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe AES Corporation price-eps-surprise | The AES Corporation QuoteHowever, a few tornados and thunderstorms, along with flooding, affected some parts of the company’s service areas, which might have led to outages for its customers. This, in turn, is likely to have had some impact on AES’ overall revenues in the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.66 billion, indicating an improvement of 0.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The tornados and thunderstorms during the third quarter might have resulted in infrastructural damage for this electricity provider, thereby increasing its quarterly operating expenses. This, along with lower contributions from LNG sales and higher interest expense from incremental debt, is expected to have hurt the company’s bottom line.Nevertheless, strong utilities’ earnings, driven by the typical second-half demand seasonality, might have contributed favorably to the company’s third-quarter earnings to some extent.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 52 cents per share, indicating a deterioration of 17.5% from the prior-year quarter’s level.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AES this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.Earnings ESP: AES’ Earnings ESP is -2.55%.

To skip the detailed analysis of the energy industry, go directly to the 5 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.Over the last few years, the energy industry has shown quite a lot of volatility due to several reasons, including but not limited to, a pandemic followed by tense geopolitical conditions. Fossil fuels were one of the most important commodities in the world up until 2012. After that, the installation of renewable energy electricity generation capacity has outpaced the fossil fuel plants.Over the last five years, the spending on renewable energy has also exceeded fossil fuel investments as the International Energy Agency estimates that total energy sector investments will reach around $2.8 trillion in 2023 and around $1.7 trillion of it will be spent on renewable energy.Fossil Fuels OutlookFossil fuels were the favorite stocks among investors in 2022 as Big Oil was able to rack up around $200 billion in profits last year and paid around $110 billion to investors in the form of dividends and share buybacks. However, the current year did not look favorably toward the oil and gas sector. In Q2, companies such as Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) reported 56% and 49% declines in profits, respectively.The third quarter was promising for global crude oil prices due to the production cuts by OPEC countries and hit record per barrel prices for the year. The price of Brent Crude oil averaged slightly above $80 in July, $86 in August, and $94 per barrel in September. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) was one of the companies that benefited the most from the surge in oil prices and is also the fourth biggest gainer of the S&P 500 in the last three months.However, in the first week of October, the high per barrel prices led to a decline in demand as we previously predicted, and the U.S. crude oil experienced its biggest weekly loss since March. Despite these fluctuations in the oil price, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts that Brent Crude oil per barrel price will average at around $84.09 and will be much higher in 2024 at $94.91.Story continuesIn the long run, the International Energy Agency (IEA) sees the fossil fuel demand drop by 25% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. The Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said in one of its reports that the oil and gas sector’s “fall has been long in the making.” It further added that the oil and gas sector covered around 29% of the S&P 500 in 1980 and is down to 5.3% today.The Global Race Toward Net-ZeroThe renewable energy sector faced some problems due to the inflationary pressures which led to higher borrowing rates and lower-than-expected investments. Even though the apprehension of inflation is still there, it is not as bad as last year. According to BloombergNEF data, global renewable energy investments were up 22% year-over-year in the first half of 2023 and reached $358 billion.The developed countries are transitioning toward renewable energy quicker than expected. In 2022, the US made $141 billion worth of investments in the sector and renewable energy accounted for 43% of the country’s global energy mix. France has also recently announced the fast-tracking of its renewable energy capacity and plans to double it by 2035. Bloomberg Law reported that the country is targeting an additional 140 to 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by that time.According to an IEA report posted in December 2022, renewable energy is forecasted to account for 90% of global electricity expansion over the next 5 years, and by 2025, it will surpass coal to become the largest source of electricity generation. Furthermore, IEA Executive Director, Fatih Birol, said that the amount of renewables added to electricity systems in 2023 will break records. He further added:“The global energy crisis has shown renewables are critical for making energy supplies not just cleaner but also more secure and affordable – and governments are responding with efforts to deploy them faster. However, achieving stronger growth means addressing some key challenges. Policies need to adapt to changing market conditions, and we need to upgrade and expand power grids to ensure we can take full advantage of solar and wind’s huge potential.”Analysts are also fairly bullish on the renewable energy sector as most of the undervalued energy stocks according to analysts in this list are mostly focusing on renewable energy. Some of the best undervalued energy stocks according to analysts include Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN), Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG), and Bloom Energy Corporation (NYSE:BE).12 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsA bustling natural gas terminal, capturing the busy flow of energy selling and distribution.

Here is what it said:\xa0“Currently, the portfolio has roughly 11% allocated across two utilities, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Polaris Renewable Energy. In the case of both equities, we have experienced disappointing 2023 market results, and in the case of AES, it is the long-book’s worst performer YTD, dragging down the overall portfolio by -2.09%. Polaris contributed a positive return of 0.21%. These two positions represent investments in similar assets but very different businesses, which explains much of the divergence in this year’s results.In the case of AES, we have a heavily US-focused utility with significant exposure to regulated and unregulated markets and a significant commitment to building out renewable energy. The firm also has some exposure to electricity markets in South America and exposure to electricity storage markets in the form of its ownership stake in Fluence (FLNC). Despite being one of the larger US utilities, the firm has trailed the sector (as measured by the IXUTR Index) dramatically this year…” (Click here to read the full text)11.

However, the majority of the assets owned by the company operate in the energy sector.In April 2023, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) agreed to acquire the intermodal freight containers’ lessor, Triton International Limited (NYSE:TRTN) for $13.3 billion in a cash and stock deal. The acquisition was completed on September 28, 2023 after the companies received all the necessary regulatory approvals.Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P.

(NYSE:BIP) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Brookfield Corporation has $7.6 billion invested through Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP), a publicly traded permanent capital vehicle that is one of the largest owners and operators of critical global infrastructure. The entity was demerged from Brookfield in 2008 and was seeded with interests in 1.2 million acres of timberlands in Canada and the United States and interests in 10,900 kilometers of electricity transmission assets in Chile, Brazil, and Canada. The oldest of these assets, Great Lakes Power Transmission Co., an electricity transmission system based in Ontario, was acquired by Brascan in 1982. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners has significantly enhanced the quality, scale, and diversity of its portfolio over the last fifteen years. The timber assets were fully divested, and rail networks, toll roads, diversified terminals, last-mile utilities, midstream energy, and digital infrastructure were added. The partnership now owns many of the world’s premier infrastructure assets, several of which were acquired for value during a dislocation. For example, in 2020 Brookfield Infrastructure Partners acquired a six percent ownership interest in Sabine Pass, the largest LNG export facility in the United States. The transaction occurred amid unprecedented lows in natural gas pricing and an oversupplied LNG market. The partnership paid $1 billion for its interest, which was funded with forty percent equity and sixty percent low cost debt. In 2022, Sabine Pass generated $2.5 billion in earnings, or approximately $120 million in earnings against Brookfield Infrastructure Partners’ $400 million equity investment, equating to a thirty percent cash on cash yield…” (Click here to read the full text)\xa0Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\xa0Suggested articles:15 Countries with the Highest Rates of Lung CancerLong Term Returns of ValueAct Capital’s Activist Targets12 Best Penny Stocks to Buy Under $1Disclosure.

Fundamentally, the underlying industry offers critical services. As you know, bad things happen when people flip the switch and the light doesn’t turn on.On a practical level for investors, utility stocks to buy benefit richly from inelastic demand. No matter what happens in the economy, both households and businesses must pay the bills. This dynamic also means that utilities can raise prices and demand won’t drop significantly. Obviously, that’s a massive advantage ahead of market uncertainty.Also, utilities enjoy a natural monopoly. Due to the capital-intensive nature of the sector, not many companies can rival entrenched utilities. Also, you have an intense regulatory framework that dissuades competition.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow, to broaden the scope of this discussion, I’ve also included energy generators and service providers. While they might not be traditional utilities, they’re vital to the overall infrastructure. And on that note, below are intriguing utility stocks to buy.Public Service Enterprise (PEG)telephone poles and power lines with sunset as backdropSource: ShutterstockBased in Newark, New Jersey, Public Service Enterprise (NYSE:PEG) is a diversified energy firm. According to its public profile, the company is its state’s oldest and largest investor-owned utility firm. Since the beginning of the year, PEG lost almost 3% of equity value. Therefore, it’s not quite a market favorite. Still, the red ink also makes it an interesting idea for undervalued utility stocks.Looking at its financials, PEG trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 10.89x. That’s noticeably lower than the sector median of 14.37x. For full disclosure, Public Service doesn’t exactly distinguish itself from other utility stocks with sterling financials. As an example, it runs a high debt load, as evidenced by its cash-to-debt ratio of 0.03X.Story continuesNevertheless, what’s important here is its strong profit margins, particularly its net margin of 24%. Also, the company carries a forward yield of 3.77%.Analysts rate PEG a moderate buy with a $65.58 price target, implying over 8% upside potential.Vistra Energy (VST)solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background representing solar stocks.Source: chuyuss / Shutterstock.comAn integrated retail electricity and power generation firm, Vistra Energy (NYSE:VST) is one of the largest utility stocks. Featuring a multi-varied business, Vistra’s portfolio includes natural gas, nuclear power, solar, and battery energy storage facilities. Based in Irving, Texas, the company carries a market capitalization just north of $12 billion.One of the best-performing utility stocks to buy, VST gained nearly 47% of equity value since the January opener. On paper, that doesn’t sound like a bargain. Still, on a financial note, VST still trades at a forward earnings multiple of 8.28x. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 13.99x. In addition, the market prices VST shares at 0.77x trailing revenue, which is also undervalued.Now, with the upside performance, Vistra isn’t the most generous in terms of its forward yield at only 2.52%. Still, it’s better than nothing, especially ahead of a possible economic slowdown.Analysts peg VST a unanimous strong buy with a $37.29 target, implying 14% growth.Brookfield Renewable (BEPC)A phone displaying the logo for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC)Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockWhile not a traditional entry among utility stocks to buy, Brookfield Renewable (NYSE:BEPC) nevertheless deserves consideration thanks to its wider importance to energy generation. Per its website, Brookfield represents one of the world’s largest platforms for renewable power and decarbonization solutions. It also features a diversified portfolio, including wind solar, and hydroelectric power.However, the main drawback of BEPC from an investment standpoint is its volatility risk. Since the start of the year, shares stumbled 21%. And in the past five years, they’re down almost 15%, which has frustrated stakeholders. Still, from a financial perspective, its trailing-year earnings multiple without non-recurring items (NRI) sits at 6.49x. In contrast, the industry median value is 14.54x.Also, the company benefits from robust top-line expansion. Its three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 29%, beating out 78.57% of its rivals. Also, BEPC features a forward yield of 5.54%.Wells Fargo’s Jonathan Reeder rates shares a buy with a $34 target, implying almost 40% upside.AES (AES)Utilities stocks: a stock image of light fixtures; one lightbulb is lit upSource: ShutterstockThough one of the riskiest utility stocks to buy from a volatility standpoint, AES (NYSE:AES) could entice “conservative” gamblers, if that makes sense. Per its public profile, AES owns and operates power plants. Through these facilities, the company generates and sells electricity to end users and intermediaries, such as utilities and industrial entities.However, as alluded to earlier, a darker side exists to the AES narrative and that is its chart “performance.” Since the start of the year, shares have tumbled more than 48%. At the same time, AES is only down a fraction relative to the beginning of its trailing five-year period. Stated differently, shares could be substantially de-risked.If you prefer a by-the-numbers approach, AES trades at a forward earnings multiple of 7.89x. That’s much lower than the 13.44x forward price-earnings ratio of the regulated utility space. Also, the company provides a forward yield of 4.57% and a low payout ratio of 35.17%.Analysts rate AES a moderate buy with a $20.29 target, also implying almost 40% growth.TransAlta (TAC)Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, TransAlta (NYSE:TAC) is an electricity power generator and wholesale marketing firm. Per its corporate profile, TransAlta operates 76 power plants in Canada, the U.S., and Australia. Further, the company operates wind, hydroelectric, natural gas, and coal power generation facilities. Though relevant like other major utility stocks, TAC hasn’t quite enjoyed a strong outing in 2023.Since the January opener, TAC gave up more than 14% of equity value. To provide the heads-up, the negativity has been severe recently. In the trailing one-month period, TAC plunged 17%. Still, for adventurous investors, there is a de-risking argument to be had. But this too is a dangerous proposition since it may be a value trap.Based on the numbers, TAC trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple (without NRI) of 10.89x. Also, it trades at 0.82x trailing revenue. Both stats are considered undervalued. Given the relevance and the forward yield of 2.12%, it’s a tempting wager.Also, analysts peg TAC a unanimous strong buy with a $11.92 target, projecting over 56% upside.Fluence Energy (FLNC)FLNC stock. Concept of renewable energy battery storage system in nature. 3d renderingSource: petrmalinak / Shutterstock.comAnother enterprise that’s not traditionally considered one of the utility stocks, Fluence Energy (NASDAQ:FLNC) is akin to the medical staff for a professional baseball club. While Fluence might not be taking at-bats (to extend the analogy), it keeps the team viable over a long season. It does this through the development, deployment, and management of energy storage systems. These systems can be used by utilities to enhance grid reliability.Unlike some other pure-play utility stocks to buy, FLNC is a solid performer in the charts. Since the beginning of this year, shares swung up more than 17%. And in the past 365 days, it returned almost 37% of market value. Notably, FLNC trades at only 1.13x trailing sales, lower than 70.4% of its peers. That’s quite remarkable considering that Fluence’s three-year revenue growth rate soars at 109.8%.In fairness, the company’s other metrics are questionable, to be diplomatic. However, it does feature a robust cash-to-debt ratio of 5.62x.Lastly, analysts rate FLNC a moderate buy with a $31.86 target, implying nearly 68% growth.Opal Fuels (OPAL)Renewable natural gas image inside clear piggy bank.Source: InvestorPlaceAs with Fluence Energy above, Opal Fuels (NASDAQ:OPAL) wouldn’t technically be considered a candidate for utility stocks. However, if you’re willing to be a little less stringent than say the governing body of Formula 1 motor racing, you might be interested in learning about Opal. As a fully integrated leader in the production and distribution of low-carbon intensity renewable natural gas (RNG), the enterprise enjoys strong forward implications.As it relates to the subject at hand, utility firms and other industrial users are rapidly discovering the vast opportunities of RNG. Further, as political and social winds pressure policymakers, RNG may become an important component of both energy security and net-zero emissions directives. So, it’s worth putting on your radar, even though it’s inking a 9% loss year-to-date.Still, that also means OPAL trades at 9x trailing earnings. It also prints an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 23.9%.On a final note, analysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $12.09 target, projecting over 93% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Using the most recent financial data, we\'ll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don\'t get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for AES Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company\'s cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$574.0mUS$123.0mUS$243.0mUS$346.0mUS$426.2mUS$498.1mUS$560.2mUS$612.6mUS$656.7mUS$694.1mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 23.18%Est @ 16.87%Est @ 12.46%Est @ 9.36%Est @ 7.20%Est @ 5.68% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% -US$532US$106US$193US$255US$291US$315US$328US$333US$331US$324(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.9bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country\'s GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year \'growth\' period, we discount future cash flows to today\'s value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$694m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.2%) = US$12bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$12b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$5.7bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$7.7b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$13.8, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.The AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company\'s future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company\'s future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company\'s potential performance. Given that we are looking at AES as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we\'ve used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.155. Beta is a measure of a stock\'s volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for AESStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Renewable Energy market.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company is unprofitable.Revenue is forecast to decrease over the next 2 years.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It\'s not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you\'d apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company\'s valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?
